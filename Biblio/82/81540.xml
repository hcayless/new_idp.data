  <note resp="#BP">Petrographic investigation on the so-called 'Coptic' limestone sculptures and reliefs of the Sheikh Ibada, now considered to be modern forgeries by most scholars. If the Sheikh Ibada group are modern forgeries, it is clear that the forgers intentionally used Mokattam limestone in order to make the Sheikh Ibada group as authentic appearing as possible. Petrographic analysis cannot, therefore, distinguish genuine sculptures and reliefs from the fake ones. The latter can only be recognized through an art historical analysis of their stylistic features.</note>
