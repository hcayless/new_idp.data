   <note resp="#BP">It seems likely that P. Hibeh I, 28 offers us political theory embodied in the constitution of an imaginary city like Plato's Magnesia. The vogue for treatises peri politeias and peri nimon continued long after Plato's death. Such is the context in which the Hibeh papyrus should be viewed.</note>
