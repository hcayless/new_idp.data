   <note resp="#BP">The insertion of the quotation from the "Oracle of the Lamb" indicates a reaction to what was perceived as a wrong interpretation of an existing oracle. Therefore, the oracle proper, or at least most of it, antedates the insertion of the quotation into the extant recensions; they may be ascribed to 130-116 B.C.</note>
