   <note resp="#BP">Cornelian stone (pl. XIV, 1) engraved with a biga drawn by two cocks; a cat riding in the chariot holds the bridle in one hand and a whip in the other. The solar significance of the cocks and the solar as well as lunar meaning of the cat permit to interpret the scene as sunrise and victory over the demons.</note>
