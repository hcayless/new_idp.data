   <note resp="#BP">In Roman Egypt, some burial practices and funerary imagery either stayed the same, or followed a new line of development linked to the past. On the other end, there are some genuine innovations, like the use of naturalistic portraiture. The combination of ancient and modern, timeless and timely, is responsible for evocative creations.</note>
