   <note resp="#BP">On the back of the agricultural report P. Tebt. I, 75 (112 B.C.) there is another text from the same year, P. Tebt. I, 33, announcing the visit of the Roman senator Lucius Memmius to the Fayoum. The link between both sides lies in the office of the basilikos grammateus, where the report of the recto had to be presented. The letter announcing the visit arrived at the office, while some of the village scribes were present. The basilikos grammateus ordered them to copy it out on a piece of papyrus, which Menches duly did.</note>
