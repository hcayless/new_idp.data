   <note resp="#BP">"What can have induced the Church so suddenly, and totally, to abandon rolls, and substitute not just codices but a single codex containing all four Gospels? It is my belief that the key to the whole situation was the publication of John (circ. 100 A.D.). The Church must have been forced to consider any physical means by which the four Gospels could be brought together and at the same time additions to their number could be discouraged. At this stage the proposal must have been made to include all four in a codex, the new form of book recently developed in Rome."</note>
