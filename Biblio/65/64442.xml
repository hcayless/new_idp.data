   <note resp="#BP">More tablet books were found in 1991/2 at Ismant el-Kharab (ancient Kellis) in Egypt's Dakhleh Oasis. There was also a small archive of papyri and a deposit of over 600 fragments of papyri, from which the text provisionally numbered P. Kellis 63 has been recovered. This private letter (early to mid-A.D. iv) refers to "a well-proportioned 10-page notebook of city quality".</note>
