   <note resp="#BP">Discusses the remains of late Roman houses located on the eastern side of the Avenue of Sphinxes which connected once Luxor temple with the Karnak complex. The author had a chance to undertake a survey and architectural studies of a small part of this settlement in the early spring of the year 1983, during the mission of the German Institute of Archaeology in Cairo. Since that time the buildings have disappeared nearly entirely and this short description might be the only data available for further studies. - 1. General description of the area. - 2. Description of individual houses. - 3. Miscellaneous finds: 3.1. [Latin] inscription, AD 177/178?; - 3.2. Burnt bricks found in the area; - 3.3. Water jug-stands. - 4. Conclusions. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
