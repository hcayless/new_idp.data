   <note resp="#BP">Considers the evidence on Cleomenes of Naucratis, chief financial administrator and actual governor of Egypt under Alexander the Great (332-323 BC). Special attention is paid to the evidence of Pseudo-Aristoteles' Oeconomica about Cleomenes. This evidence seems to have been inspired by the standard topoi of Egyptian propaganda in the 4th century BC. These topoi must have been intended to represent unfavourably not only Cleomenes, but also Alexander standing behind him, and were probably re-used by the satrap Ptolemy's propaganda. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
