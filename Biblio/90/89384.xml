   <note resp="#BP">Wreck recovered in 1983 in an underwater zone adjacent to Naḥal Megadim, on the Carmel coast. The coins belonged to three hoards: 55 medium-sized Ptolemaic bronze coins (Hoard 1), probably from the joint reign of Cleopatra III and Ptolemy IX; 19 silver tetradrachms (Hoard 2), ranging from Ptolemy VIII to Ptolemy X (152/1-100/99 BCE); and 10 bronze coins that were found within an amphora (Hoard 3), dating between c. 180 (?) and 168 BCE. It is likely that the Ptolemaic silver coins of Hoard 2 belonged to the ship's owner, a crew member or a passenger, and were current at the time the ship was lost, thus suggesting that the ship was Ptolemaic. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
