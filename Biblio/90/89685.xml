   <note resp="#BP">Presents an attempt to reconsider the origin of the "Periplus of the Erythraean Sea". In contrast to the commonly accepted opinion which regards the "Periplus" as a kind of trader's guide-book proposes to treat this source as a commentary to a map, which was lost. The origin of the "Periplus" is to be searched not from the point of view of commercial activity of its unknown composer, but rather in terms of cartographical ideas of a person who composed it on the basis of sources rooted in various traditions of different epochs. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
