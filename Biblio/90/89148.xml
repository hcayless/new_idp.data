   <note resp="#BP">Economic and political relationships between Rome and Egypt significantly changed during the first century BC: the presence of Rome was not only linked to commercial activities, it also appeared in the Ptolemaic army and in the management of land property in the Egyptian chora. This paper focuses on Lucius Septimius, a landowner attested in a land register [P. Lond. II, 195 (p. 127)] dating from the Julio-Claudian age: he can be identified with a namesake, who was a council member of Ptolemy XIII and tribunus militum in the Ptolemaic army during the second half of the first century BC. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
