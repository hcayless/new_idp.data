   <note resp="#BP">Proposes an interpretation of the concept behind Manetho's treatise on Egyptian history (first half of the 3rd century BC). Gives general observations on the Egyptian ideas of evolution of the world and its cycles, about the large historical periods reflected in the Egyptian narrative tradition. Reasons are given to consider that the evidence of the Classical authors (especially Josephus Flavius) and Christian chronographers connected with the name of Manetho was in accordance with his original concept.</note>
