   <note resp="#BP">The original weight of a stone object found at Umm Balad in the Eastern Desert [edd.: Steven E. SIDEBOTHAM, Ronald E. ZITTERKOPF and John A. RILEY, Survey of the 'Abu Sha'ar - Nile Road, AJA 95 (1991) pp. 581-582] was 'slightly over 29 kg'. Through texts from Mons Claudianus it is now known that the standard ration for a quarry-worker for one month was 55 pairs of loaves of bread, baked from 1 artaba of grain [= 31.029 kg, i.e. 29.16 kg of bread, due to 6 % weight-loss in grinding/baking].</note>
