   <note resp="#BP">"I originally proposed that the poet himself moved the Epilogue to its current position at the end of Book 4 [The Epilogue to the Aetia, GRBS 26 (1985) pp. 59-65]; in a forthcoming book [Callimachus and his Critics, Princeton U.P.], Alan Cameron argues that this was probably done by a later editor. I offer some additional evidence [P. Mil. Vogl. I, 18 (= Pack2 211); P. Oxy. VII, 1011 (= Pack2 215)] in support of Cameron's suggestion."</note>
