   <note resp="#BP">Two unpublished parchment fragments, written in Coptic on both faces. Provenance unknown (Medinet-el-Fayoum?), the dating has been left open. Likely a late monastic manuscript: religious vocabulary; nomina sacra; list of the disciples in the same order as in the Gospel of Matthew. Perhaps a Christian commentary, homily, or some other type of theological work that cites Matthew's Gospel.</note>
