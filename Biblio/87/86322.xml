   <note resp="#BP">Since membership of the gymnasial order was controlled more strictly than for the metropolites, this group was long considered an elite within an elite. Building on the theory that they were, rather, distinct groups that developed side by side, the author pursues the question of the origins of these orders and the implications of their 'closing' in the second half of the first century AD. - The early years of οἱ ἀπὸ γυμνασίου and the μητροπολῖται. - The 'closing' of the orders. - The creation and the restriction of the orders revisited. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
