   <note resp="#BP">In 1996 an area containing élite burials dating from the AD 1st century was discovered within a Late Scythian necropolis. Tomb 620 occupied a prominent place among the rich burials. Among the numerous and diverse finds one of particular interest was an object which was described in the first publication to appear as "a wooden pyxis cylindrical in shape and with a silver plaque attached" [height 8.6 - 9 cm?]. Subsequent examinations of this find have made it possible to draw the conclusion that it is a scrinium (capsa, cista, κίστη, τεΰχος) - a special case in which to store papyrus texts. The fine whittled sticks found together with the case are none other than ὀμφαλοί or umbilici - small sticks, attached to the ends of scrolls.</note>
