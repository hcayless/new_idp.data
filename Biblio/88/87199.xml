   <note resp="#BP">Late Antique sources attest to an Arabian presence in pre-Islamic Egypt which is apparently absent from the archaeological record. However, explorers and archaeologists working in the Eastern Desert of Egypt have repeatedly noted 'enigmatic settlements.' These do not readily conform to familiar Graeco-Roman models, and instead find parallels in the Umayyad Levant and North Africa.</note>
