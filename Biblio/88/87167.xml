   <note resp="#BP">Presents the results of radiocarbon dating for linen hairnets undertaken as part of Dress ID Project: Clothing and identities, new perspectives on textiles in the Roman Empire. Twenty-one hairnets in seven international collections were sampled, and their IQR (interquartile range) was found to be between AD 446 and 635, thus defining the period in which this fashion peaked. The 90% probability range, covering the whole period for these artefacts, was between AD 343 and 753. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
