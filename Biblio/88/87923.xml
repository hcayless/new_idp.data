   <note resp="#BP">Owners of cargo (principals) often had to make use of persons organizing the selling of the goods (agents). Within the framework of trade in the Red Sea, agents were used on different points of the route, but their social status and consequently the legal and/or social form of principal-agent relationship depended on the social and cultural background of the people engaged in this trade: Romans used freedmen and slaves as agents, while Alexandrians and other people of Roman Egypt preferred to use free agents.</note>
