   <note resp="#BP">Presented at a conference held at Otago University in Dunedin, New Zealand, 23-25 August, 2006. - Concludes that Alexander was probably not considered divine by most Egyptians. The Egyptian concept of the divinity of the pharaoh was complex and ambiguous and changeable over time. It depended often on certain rituals, which Alexander did not complete. The Ptolemies are probably responsible for the notion of Alexander's divinity.</note>
