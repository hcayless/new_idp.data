   <note resp="#BP">The origins of Christianity in India are intermingled with legend, and it is commonly held that saint Thomas arrived in southern India in the mid-first century AD on a trading ship originating in Alexandria. His landing spot is thought to have been the important Malabar port of Muziris, only recently located on the ground in the modern state of Kerala. Two questions can be posed in this context: What role did Indian Ocean trade play in the diffusion of Christianity? What role did Christians and Christianity play in Indian Ocean trade?</note>
