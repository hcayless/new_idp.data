  <note resp="#BP">Preliminary account of 17 small parchment fragments [acquired in London in 2001; provenance unknown], which have been the subject of detailed study by members of the team of the Projet Volterra. The fragments have been identified as coming from a legal text in Latin, indeed possibly all from the same page, written in a fifth-century uncial book-hand, but with some numeration and glosses in Greek. The fragments contain part of a rubricated title, as well as the headings and subscripts to several imperial rescripts of third-century emperors (Caracalla, Gordian III and the Philips are explicitly named), organized in a broadly chronological sequence without intervening commentary. Three rescripts overlap with texts known from the Justinian Code (C. 7.62.3, 4, and 7). It is argued that the work in the fragments is from neither the first nor second editions of the Justinian Code, nor from a juristic miscellany. Despite the apparently anomalous presence of a tetrarchic rescript (otherwise typically attributed to the Hermogenian Code), the conclusion is that these fragments most plausibly represent the only known remains of a manuscript of the lost Gregorian Code. - A full publication of the fragments as a small monograph is planned for 2013.</note>
