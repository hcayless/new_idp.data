  <note resp="#BP">Archeological excavations carried out since 2002 by a Polish expedition in Banganarti, a village located ten kilometers to the south of the ruins of Dongola, revealed two churches one standing atop the other. The upper church, probably built in the 11th century, was towards the end of its usage, the goal of numerous pilgrimages, which is proved by almost a thousand inscriptions left on its walls by worshippers. The inscriptions are composed in either local Nubian language or in Greek. They usually mention the name of the visitor, occasionally accompanied by additional information about the person, such as father's name, the place of origin, profession or function, in case of clergy, also the place of ecclesiastic service.</note>
