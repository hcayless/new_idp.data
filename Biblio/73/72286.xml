   <note resp="#BP">In numismatic terms, it would seem that Ptolemy defeated Demetrius at the very beginning of the minting year 312/11, perhaps in October itself, and the Ptolemaic issues may well have been the first from the Sidonian mint for 312/11. The Sidonian mint was under Ptolemaic control for less than half of the year, perhaps 4-5 months, and must have been firmly back in Antigonid hands by March or April of 311.</note>
