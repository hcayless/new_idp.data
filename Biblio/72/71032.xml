   <note resp="#BP">P.G.M. IV, 296-434. "If we are trying to explain the history of a series of magical rituals inscribed in the Greek language and buried in Egyptian soil during the Roman period, we need to eschew overly simplistic arguments of pure ethnic influence and try to imagine a much more complex historical process in which Greek, Semitic and Egyptian features have been combined, adapted and then recombined."</note>
