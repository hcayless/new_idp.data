   <note resp="#BP">The reception of Aristophanes and Menander may well be one of the oldest cases of 'studied' or 'directed' reception. It was most likely Plutarch himself who subjected both playwrights to an (unfair) comparison, and who fiercely condemned Aristophanes in favour of Menander (Moralia 853a–854d). Plutarch set the stage for many centuries of history and criticism in the same vein.</note>
