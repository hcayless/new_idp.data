   <note resp="#BP">The marks are often placed in the corners of large rectangular woolen fabrics interpreted as mantles. The finds of textiles with signs are mostly dated to the period from the 1st to the 3rd century AD, with the exception of some pieces from Nubia, dated as late as the 6th or even the 7th century. Many of the textiles have been excavated from graves, some of them were found in caves, like At-Tar and Qumran, or in a dump at Mons Claudianus, or next to a fortification, like in Masada.</note>
