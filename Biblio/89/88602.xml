   <note resp="#BP">The recently published P. Oxy. LXXI, 4808 [= M.-P.3 2257.01; LDAB 112363], an evaluation of Alexander and Diadoch historians, says that Cleitarchus was the tutor of Ptolemy IV (Philopator), a notice that, if true, would significantly affect the 'high' dating of Cleitarchus by which he is assigned to the end of the 4th / beginning of the 3rd c. BC. Re-assesses the evidence for the high dating of Cleitarchus, concluding that it remains likeliest, and that the new papyrus' date is incorrect and ought not to affect the communis opinio. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
