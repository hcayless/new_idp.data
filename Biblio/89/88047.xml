   <note resp="#BP">References to political institutions, politicians and even the wars that plagued early Hellenistic Athens, have been largely supplanted in Menander's comedy by a concern for the household, its composition and reproduction. Whereas Aristophanic comedy abounds with references to known extra-dramatic realities, Menander's comedies create a self-contained repetitive fantasy where citizens worry only about their romantic lives or those of their family members.</note>
