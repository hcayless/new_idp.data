   <note resp="#BP">The ruler cult proved successful as a means of communication between the subordinate cities and the Ptolemies and as an instrument for asserting the authority of the Egyptian kings. It also turned out to be an important platform in contacts with the poleis which were loosely or not at all subjugated by the Lagids. Granting kings divine honours was not only an expression of the city's gratefulness for the experienced kindness, but also a way of securing the king's continued favour. As Ptolemaic influences in the Aegean Basin weakened, the evidence of the cult of Lagids being established waned. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
