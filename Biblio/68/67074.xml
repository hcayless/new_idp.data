   <note resp="#BP">This study started as the author was reading through two Greek lists of goods belonging to the family archive of Dryton, P. Lond. II, 402 verso and an unpublished Heidelberg papyrus, P. Heid. Inv. G 1320. Most of the parallels come from the Zenon archive, among them P. Cairo Zenon IV, 59659. - 1. Imagine that the cavalryman Dryton (or Esthladas) has found a horse to his mind. What kind of equipment does he need to ride the horse? - 2. Imagine that the cavalryman Dryton (or Esthladas) has to take part in a campaign. How should a man be armed who is to face danger on horseback? - 3. Imagine that the cavalryman Dryton or Esthladas has finished his ride and wants to take care of his horse. What kind of equipment did he have for grooming?</note>
