   <note resp="#BP">There is sound evidence to support the meaning of σπάτιον / σπάθιον in the Egyptian documents as a "wineskin" or as a "skin (of wine, oil, or fish sauce)". It is possible that σπάτιον / σπάθιον was introduced into Egypt by the merchants who frequented the Palestinian wine producing centers of Gaza and Ascalon.</note>
