   <note resp="#BP">Socnopaiou Nesos - unlike Karanis and Philadelphia - was astonishingly unaffected by the Roman occupation of Egypt, and only peripherally affected by its previous hellenization. Socnopaiou Nesos had very little desirable land, and thus it was of no interest to the Greeks and Romans.</note>
