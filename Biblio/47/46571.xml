   <note resp="#BP">The banquet scene (Ad Philocratem, 187-292) shows to some extent Aristeas' desire to master Hellenistic culture, to offer a serious contribution to current political thought, both Jewish and Greek. Aristeas set out to give, within a somewhat incongruous framework, a view of kingship based on that adopted by the Ptolemies, which would yet be acceptable to Egyptian Judaism. The age was one when it was appropriate to declare the loyalty of Jews to the régime.</note>
