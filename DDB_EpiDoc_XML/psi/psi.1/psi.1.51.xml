                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/pheilpor">Vote - AcceptText - Accept. I agree with Graham that the Herakleides of SB XVI 12299 is not the same man (too late and not the same hand). On the other hand, the signatures of PSI I 51 and SB XXII 15759 look indeed similar (though there are some differences, such as the way ἀντιγραφεύς is abbreviated) and close enough in date to be from the same man. In SB XXII 15759, the delta is clearly to be seen. Therefore, the little spot of ink here, after the iota and before the α of ἀντιγραφεύς, must be meant to be a delta. I'm not even sure the 3 previous letters really need to get underdots: Ἡρακλείδ̣(ης)? – Also, should we mention that P.J. Sijpesteijn, ChrEg 53 (1978) p. 138, tacitly corrected the name to Ἡράκλεις (sic, for the accent) ? I would have it as an alt – it's as good a reading as Ἡρακλείδ̣(ης) here, though the parallel of SB XVI 12299 weights in in favor of Ἡρακλείδ̣(ης). &#xD;
Furthermore, now that we have the online image, we can also confirm the reading suggested by Bingen (BL 6.173) for the title, and remove the question mark after ἀντιγρ(αφεύς). It was separately suggested by P.J. Sijpesteijn, ChrEg 53 (1978) p. 139, n. 1 (based on a photograph provided to him by R. Pintaudi).&#xD;
In line 4, BL 7.231 has Τεφερᾶτο(ς) (from Sijpesteijn), but the online image shows that it is Τεφερᾶτ(ος).</change>

                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/gclaytor">Vote - AcceptText - I've had a look at the original of SB 22 15759 and compared it with the image of this text.  I agree with Gad that they the signatures in question belong to the same hand.  The precise reading of the name, however, is difficult.  The reading of the ed.pr. can at least be discarded because ed.pr.'s ων is now partly used for the new and certain reading ἀντιγρ(αφεύς).  It's worth noting that Bingen only commented on the official's title, not his name, but BL 6.173 reported the correction as "Wohl Ἡρακλείων ἀντιγρ(αφεὺς)" κτλ.  As for the reading Ἡρακλείδ(ης) in both texts, I'm a little uncomfortable with the shape of epsilon, particularly its two humps, but can accept it.  In the PSI text, I agree with Gad's reading of delta at the end -- there is a clear spot of ink before, and partly overlapping with, the alpha of ἀντιγρ(αφεύς), which I would take as a poorly-formed delta on the strength of the parallel and the commonness of the abbreviation Ἡρακλειδ( ), even if Ἡρακλει( ) is not unknown.  As an aside, the Herakleides of SB 16 12299 is not the same man as here, because that text was written about 40 years later and the signature is in a different hand. </change>

                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/joshuad.sosin">Vote - DEFER - At lin.6 Gad proposes Ἡρακλ̣ε̣ί̣ω̣ν̣ =&gt; Ἡρακλ̣ε̣ί̣δ̣(ης), and that the signature there is the same as at SB XXII 15759.6. I urge someone at Michigan should look at both the original Mich piece and this. I think I'd be more inclined in both cases to read (the admittedly less common abbreviation) Ἡρακλ̣ε̣ί̣(δ̣ης); I'd have thought the sweeping downstroke a iota. But I could easily be wrong.</change>
