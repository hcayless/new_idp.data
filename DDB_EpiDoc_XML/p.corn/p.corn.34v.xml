                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/james.cowey">Vote - Return-Straight-to-Sender - Most of the readings here are fine, but there are one or two which I think should be looked at again before resubmitting this text. I also include a couple of corrections to Leiden+ usage. lin4 Θέων[.?] -&gt; Θέων [.?]. Ἄρτεμις is clear in lines 6 and 8. In lin7 the form of the rho is different. The tau is fine. Thereafter something like epsilon, iota alpha/lambda are easier to make out than εμις. In lin5 I am not convinced that the line starts with an alpha, rho is possible as is tau but there is lots of space between them. The form of the epsilon is quite different from many of the epsilons elsewhere. The top righthand portion of the my would be very compressed before the descending iota. I think more more uncertainty must be made clear here or perhaps just unread underdots would be more acceptable. In lin13 I am fairly sure that after the long descending iota the tip of the alpha is actually visible so instead of Παλλαδί[α .?] (which should by the way be Παλλαδί[α ][.?]) I would suggest Παλλαδία [.?]. In lin17-21 instead of [.3] it should be [ca.3], because we cannot be certain that it was always 3 letters that are missing. lin26 I would contend that there is nothing left to be seen of the rho so instead of Ἄρτεμις [.?] the reading should be  Ἄ[ρ]τεμις [.?]. Many thanks for your efforts.</change>

                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/nikos">This is an edition of a described papyrus based on the original.&#xD;
In the introduction of the ed. princ. of P.Corn. 34 there is description of the list of names on the back “the ends of the lines are lost and the purpose of the list is therefore unknown. Two of the names are new: Ἱππέων and Αδωρα[. Among the rest are Ταῆσις, Ἀδέλφι[ος], Θέων, Ἄρτεμις, Ἀντώνιος, and Παλλάδιος”. It seems that the first line was written in ἔκθεσις and it was the title of the list. The remaining traces are not enough to clarify the writing. The first letter has an elongated vertical stroke. However, most of the names are feminine. Only in l. 8 Ἵππων[, as it stands, is masculine, but since we have no indication for the ending (e.g. Ἱππών[ασσα]) we have to take into account this possibility. And, in l. 23 Ἁ̣ρ̣̣π̣̣αῆσι[ς is an uncertain reading.&#xD;
Below there is a transcription of these names read on original. Image in http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/apis/x-3438/c1_93v.tif.&#xD;
&#xD;
The commentary on the papyrus is:&#xD;
3	Rather ἀδελφή̣ [ than Ἀδέλφι̣[ος etc; cf. l. 9 γυνή.&#xD;
11	Ἀντωνία or [Ἀντώνιο[ς?&#xD;
13	Παλλαδί[α or Παλλάδι[ος? For the feminine cf. P.Oxy. LVI 3859, 27 (IV A.D.).&#xD;
