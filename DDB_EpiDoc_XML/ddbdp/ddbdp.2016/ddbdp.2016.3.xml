It is a list, in Latin, of cavalry soldiers assigned to the local watch ('ad tutelam loci'); it was first described by G. Bastianini in the introduction to P.Bagnall 5. The document is formatted so that the name of each soldier precedes, on a separate line, the name of the cavalry unit (turma) to which he belonged. The papyrus breaks off in line 6, just after the unit of the second soldier is given.</p><p>Since publication of P.Bagnall 5, Bastianini and R. Ast have made some progress towards deciphering previously unread parts of the document. These new readings suggest that the soldiers performed the watch on a rotating basis, perhaps in daily intervals.</p></div>

We suggest reading either 'quater', 'four times', or 'quater(ni)', 'in groups of four'. Loss of the bottom part of the papyrus prevents us from telling if the soldiers were listed in groups of four.</p></item>

               <item corresp="#lb4" xml:space="preserve"><ref>4</ref> <p>Turma of Victor or Victorinus: the right side of 'r' at the end of 'Victor' has been drawn out in exaggerated fashion as an extended line. It is unclear if this was for decorative purpose or to signal an abbreviation. </p></item>
               <item corresp="#lb5" xml:space="preserve"><ref>5</ref> <p>For reasons of space, Apion is better than [An]upion. While 'on' is clear even in the photo, 'Api' is best seen on the original, which Bastianini has consulted. Similar to the 'r' in 'Victor', the base of the final 'n' has been extended in a horizontal line.</p></item>
