                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/dkaltsas">Vote - AcceptText - I do not find all changes by Łukaszewicz convincing, but since they are based on autopsy (and have been carefully checked by C.B.), they must be recorded. // lin1, I agree with encoding suggested by James. // lin2, ditto (retain the full stop; it is obviously implied by Łukaszewicz, see his translation). // lin6–7, ditto; but underdot ΑΙ of [ca.4]εσται, as implied by Łukaszewicz's discussion, and also add accent on ἐπαν]έστη. I actually incline to -εσται and think the abnormal size / spacing of the ΑΙ could have been caused by the scribe's wish to avoid some imperfection on his writing surface immediately after this. (Łukaszewicz presumably meant ‘at the end of the word’ rather than ‘line’). // lin8, ditto, with the following observations: a. at both ends of the line, Manteuffel's readings only ever made sense in conjunction with his own version of the text at the end of l. 7 and the beginning of l. 9. So perhaps leave them out altogether? b. I think the letter count at the beginning should not be omitted, even if Łukaszewicz does not expressly give it. One could retain .6. // lin12: I find ἢ̣ τ̣ά̣[ξα]ι very hard to believe (it is also not the best way to transcribe, since there are traces of all letters extant). At least give &lt;:&lt;:η̣.4ι|alt|ἢ̣ τ̣ά̣[ξα]ι:&gt;=A. Łukaszewicz, JJurP 26 (1996) 92 and 97|ed|ἢ τὴν:&gt; (possibly with the BL page as an equivalent). // Underdots (just to be consistent): lin3, νῦ̣ν̣ ἤ̣δη; lin5, remove underdot in βλαβῇ̣ς, the eta is certain. lin9, εὐετηρ̣ί̣α̣ π̣ολλή. // Some accents that need to be corrected: lin1 Φιλώτας; lin8 μηδὲ; lin9 ἀλλὰ σοῦ; lin13 ἐάν σοι; lin14 δὲ σο̣ῦ̣. </change>

                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/james.cowey">Vote - AcceptText - A. Łukaszewicz follows the text of P.Edfou III 8. SB VI 9302 follows the text of Böhm from AbhKM 1955. That explains the difference in lin8&#xD;
&#xD;
P.Edfou III 8: [μαι μ]ατεσαι τὰ ἀπολέσται, μηδὲ ... σμηιε πρό&#xD;
Böhm: have not seen this, but presumably what went into the production of&#xD;
SB VI 9302: [  ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣]ατες αὐτὰ ἀπολεσται ἀηδη   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣ μήδε προ&#xD;
SB VI 9302 actually printed capitals [  ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣]ΑΤΕΣ ΑΥΤΑ ΑΠΟΛΕΣΤΑΙ ΑΗΔΗ . . . . ΜΗΔΕ ΠΡΟ&#xD;

lin2 should be encoded &lt;:κληρού̣[χων. ἐπε]ιδὴ=A. Łukaszewicz, JJP 26 (1996) 91|ed|κληρο[ύχων. ἐπε]ιδὴ:&gt;, I think&#xD;
leaving the full stop is OK.&#xD;

not sure whether this should be included at all. Where Łukaszewicz says "εσται n'est pas impossible, mais à la fin de la ligne, &#xD;
il ya très peu place pour αι" I do not really follow because this is in the middle of lin7 and is followed clearly by an&#xD;
empty space before τοιαύτην.&#xD;

                 who="https://papyri.info/editor/users/joshuad.sosin">Vote - DEFER - DEFER. This should have two pair of eyes, beyond my initial reaction. This turns out to be somewhat complicated. In lin1 the plate at JJP (1996) between pp92-93 and online (http://www.papyrology.uw.edu.pl/papyri/med_pmn140153.jpg) I can scarcely see a trace of the second rho in πυρσουρ̣[ὸ]ς. But OK. In any case the reading is not to be attributed to Łukaszewicz, who states (p3) that Van't Dack proposed it at CdE 37 (1962) 338-341; Łukaszewicz accepts. This has already been picked up by BL V 112 (ProsPtol V 120), which could be added to Lin1. Lin2 the corrected punctuation cannot be accepted: &lt;:κληρού̣[χων ἐπε]ιδὴ=Α. Łukaszewicz, JJurP XXVI, 1996, p.91|ed|κληρο[ύχων. ἐπε]ιδὴ:&gt; ; ed has κληρο[ύχων, ἐπε]ιδὴ and corrected κληρού̣[χων ἐπε]ιδὴ is wrong. Lin6-7 syntax should be: &lt;:πο7.- [ταμὸν λιμὸς] [ca.4]εστη̣=PN Α. Łukaszewicz, JJurP XXVI (1996) 92 (autopsy)|ed|πο7.- [ταμὸν λιμὸς ἐπαν]εστη:&gt; ; lin8 first corr is not really apt since SB VI 9302 has ΑΤΕΣ ΑΥΤΑ ; we could change corr to ατεσαυ̣τα from ατεσ αυτα ; lin8 second corr : I suppose I can see μηδ̣, but μηδ̣ε̣μ̣ is a stretch for me ; it is not obvious to me that .1σμηιεπρο (note correction to syntax) is superior to μηδε προ (unconstrued as in SB VI 9302); lin10 τοι with circumflex on omicron ; lin12 η̣.4ι is consistent with what I see ; but on p.97 the author proposes ἢ̣ τ̣ά̣[ξαι] , which is not obviously correct to me. If accepted, all apps would have to be attributed on basis of (autopsy).</change>

The most important change is πυρσουρός from previous Πυρσοῦτος, as has been sufficiently proved by the editor. Other corrections, all from Lukaszewicz's article, include minor changes, mostly underdots and square brackets.</change>
