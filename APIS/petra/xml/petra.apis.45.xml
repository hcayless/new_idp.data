                        <summary>45-47 are receipts from the payment of taxes for the annona militaris by Theodoros, son of Obodianos to the same persons. 45 and 46 were rolled together, and 47 was discovered within 20 cm of them. Payments are evidently not made to ofﬁcials, but rather to previous owners of the plots mentioned in each text. According to the general practice in Petra, although land had changed ownership, the tax registers were for some reason not updated for several years and the previous owner remained responsible for the tax payments. There are three signatures with no names preserved in 45. However, the ﬁrst two appear identical to the hands of Patrikios and Ailianos in 47. Moreover, the third signature belongs almost certainly to Nikias, Ailianos’ brother..</summary>
