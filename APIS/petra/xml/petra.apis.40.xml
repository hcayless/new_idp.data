                        <summary>A defensio of person X's right to sell an outbuilding. Person X has acquired some real estate from Y, including house(s) and half of an outbuilding without anyone disputing this transaction. After that, X has further sold a part of the property, namely (at least) two ﬁrst-ﬂoor rooms with half of the outbuilding, to Z. Now a fourth person, W, has testiﬁed that the possession of this half of the outbuilding belongs to some other people. The document was written by X (the seller) for Z (the buyer). In it he conﬁrms the transactions and states that the new person W must bring evidence for his testimony, and announces that he will sue a person called Georgios, son and of Stephanos, son of Leontios. This document might thus be dealing with the same block of houses which was under dispute in 39. In 39 there are several references to defensio, which seems to mean the seller’s obligation to defend his original ownership and thus his right to sell the property to the buyer in case someone else claims the ownership afterwards.</summary>

                            <note type="general">Written in one wide column along the ﬁbers. The right margin (3.5 cm) is preserved, while the left margin may be visible in only one fragment. Extant middle part concists of ten lines (plus traces from two others) and it is difﬁcult to estimate how many lines are missing from the top and the lower part. Perhaps the fragments of XXIX L contain missing pieces. If the size of the roll is correctly estimated, the roll originally consisted of four papyrus sheets. The greatest part of fourth, which only contained the right margin, was cut off. Τhe hand is an upright cursive, ﬂuent and practiced.</note>
