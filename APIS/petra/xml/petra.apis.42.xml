                        <summary>A dotal contract (προικῷον ϲυμβόλαιον) between Kyra and Thomas, an embathmos in the fort of Sadaqa. Unfortunately, the document is so fragmentary that it is impossible to reconstruct even the broad lines of its content. Those words which can be read in the present contract refer to the ﬁnancial aspects of marriage. It appears that 42 did not use much space to list the actual dowry items. Perhaps that is why a separate memorandum, 43, was drawn up later.</summary>

                            <note type="general">Written transversa charta and was originally tied with a string. The roll may originally have contained 140–80 lines of text. Top margin at least 8 cm, left margin at least 1 cm and bottom margin at least 20 cm. Τhe original lines of the scribe could have contained ca. 40 letters, the hands of the signatories somewhat more. In addition to the scribe who wrote the text reasonably well, with only occasional errors (m1), the hands of eight signatories can be identiﬁed.
