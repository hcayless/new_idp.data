                        <summary>45-47 are receipts from the payment of taxes for the annona militaris by Theodoros, son of Obodianos to the same persons. 45 and 46 were rolled together, and 47 was discovered within 20 cm of them. Payments are evidently not made to ofﬁcials, but rather to previous owners of the plots mentioned in each text. According to the general practice in Petra, although land had changed ownership, the tax registers were for some reason not updated for several years and the previous owner remained responsible for the tax payments.The two persons who receive Theodoros’ payments in 47 and sign the receipt are called Patrikios, son of Ailianos, and Ailianos, son of Monaxios.</summary>

                            <note type="general">Written transversa charta. Three margins are extant: top margin at least 1 cm, left margin at least 1 cm and bottom margin 1 c. The right side has been completely lost. Three hands are easily distinguished. The ﬁrst is a ﬂuent and practiced hand that has written the receipt. The second and third hands are those of Flavius Patrikios, son of Ailianos, and Flavius Ailianos, son of Monaxios, with all the names preserved. In particular, the hand of Ailianos betrays an aura of elegance.</note>
