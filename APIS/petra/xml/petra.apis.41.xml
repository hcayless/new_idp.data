                        <summary>A deed of sale with attachment(s) clarifying the uncertain ownership of the target. The seller is Ioannes, son of Stephanos and brother of Georgios. The buyer is perhaps Theodoros, son of Obodianos, who, as we know from 39, already owns a part of the same block where at least one of Stephanos’ properties was and where the ownership relations were highly disputed.</summary>

                            <note type="general">Written in columns along the ﬁbers, and it contains at least two documents related to each other. The preserved parts show two intercolumnia (at least 3 cm), suggesting that the roll contained at least three columns (normal width of ca. 60 cm). None of the intercolumnia has text on both sides, so there is an alternative possibility of two or three separate sheets wrapping around each other. The hand of the scribe is a professional, medium-sized cursive. The distance between lines is rather large (1.5–2 cm). Column I bears a document of unknown content with signatures, written in the same hand as Col. II and Col. III. Column II is not in a much better state of preservation than Column I. The third column, coming from the end of the roll and thus from its core, is the best preserved. Extant right margin ca. 5 cm.</note>
