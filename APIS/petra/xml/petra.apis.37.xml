                        <summary>A tax receipt addressed to Theodoros, son of Obodianos, by Flavius Kyrikos on behalf of his wife Arista. The document was drawn up for Kyrikos by Flavius Nonnos, son of Auxon, who may have been a military prior in Sadaqa. Kyrikos acknowledges that he and Arista have received taxes from Theodoros for a certain piece of grainland situated in a place called Sargadi[ , probably in or near Sadaqa.</summary>

                            <note type="general">Written transversa charta acros the ﬁbers. Found alongside 38, the documents were rolled separately but bundled together and tied with a string. Top margin at least 2 cm and bottom margin 3 cm. Nonnos' handwriting is a quite easily legible cursive but he has problems with most vowels. Kyrikos has subscribed the end of the document.  In addition, the hands of three witnesses are present.</note>
