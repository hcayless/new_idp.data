                        <summary>A draft of a will by someone who names as his heir a female or institution in the feminine. Many individual items and sums are left as legacies to various people and pious institutions, but their identity is lost. As the text is only a draft, there are neither subscriptions nor date.</summary>

Three margins extant: top (1 cm), right (0–2 cm) and bottom (1 cm). The text in a fairly clear, sloping cursive. The writer has problems with all the easily confused letters, sometimes canceling words and replacing them with text written between the lines. The handwriting gets smaller towards the end.</note>
