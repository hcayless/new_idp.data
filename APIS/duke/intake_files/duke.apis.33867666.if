cu520 | 6 | Division of property from Egypt, written on papyrus. The division of property is presumably an inheritance. The property was originally divided in five equal shares, one share of the property sometimes being shared by more than one individual (for example: brothers). Some of these individuals are now dead, which necessitates a new division. The text ends abruptly and no signatures follow. Perhaps the document was left unfinished. Verso has an account of expenses in Greek (P.Duk.inv. 783 V)
