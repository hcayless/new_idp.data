cu520 | 8 | Petition from Panopolis (modern name: Akhmim), Egypt, written on papyrus. Ammon, the well-known scholastikos, or lawyer, petitions the praefectus Aegypti or prefect of Egypt. Someone has harmed his "island" land, which he had planted with vines and other perennials with great care and expense. Ammon has made regular tax payments for the land. Ammon's opponent has impeded its water supply by encroaching upon other(?) land belonging to Ammon. Also mentions Flavius Eutolmius Tatianus, apparently still the governor of the Thebaid and not yet the prefect of Egypt, which he became in January A.D. 367. Belongs to the archive of Ammon. Recto has a petition in Greek (P.Duk.inv. 179 R)
