cu520 | 8 | Draft of a petition from Panopolis (modern name: Akhmim), Egypt. Written by Ammon, the well-known scholastikos, or lawyer, and his daughter. They write to the prefect of Egypt against a man who has repeatedly encroached on the land of Ammon himself and of the orphaned child(ren) of his daughter. His daughter's husband Helladios has died, and she now manages the property through a tenant. The accused planted a vineyard on part of the property while Ammon was in Panopolis and could not go out in the fields because of his illness and his age. Ammon stresses the fact that other land of his is not productive either because it cannot be watered. Part of the archive of Ammon
