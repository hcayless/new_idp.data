cu500_t | 1 | [Side 1:] Be earnest, therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and I will dine with him, and he with me. The one who conquers, to him I will give to sit with me on my throne, just as I myself conquered and sat with my father on his throne. The one who has ears, let him hear what the spirit says to the churches. After [Side 2:] these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice, which I heard speaking to me like a trumpet, saying, *Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.* Immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, and one sitting on the throne, and the one sitting on the throne was like in appearance
