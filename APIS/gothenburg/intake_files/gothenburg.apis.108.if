cu500_t | 1 | To my lord brother Herakleios. Apollonios (is greeting you). Having heard that you have come under the same constraint, I was really not pleased, except so far as it is possible, with the help of God, for us to strive to borrow this too. I cannot tell how much my brother Heron suffered when he was in Lykopolis to arrest Ktistes, the dealer in unguents. Since, as in an enemie's city, so everybody approached him so that he was almost killed by your fellow-citizens. However, since you are their epistates, I have handed over the present situation, although I am able to demand legal remedy from the authorities. But in order that this affair will be finished and the command accomplished, I wish above all, my lord brother, that it will really be possible for you, through the authorities, to send this Ktistes away, when he has first given security to you so that he will not be able to escape again. (2nd hand:) I wish you good health, my lord brother ... Verso: To my lord [brother] Herakleios ... Apollonios
