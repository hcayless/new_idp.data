cu500_t | 1 | To my brothers, greetings. ... I have learned all ... 29th of Pachon, from Triadelphos ... having got a letter from you, presbyteros ... Make immediately all clear to me and send the diakatoche, as it is called, when you have signed it, so that I can sign and deliver it; in this way I will thereafter always observe the marriage-contract, so that they will not wish to do anything through petitions. You should inquire into what they want or prefer to do and write to me [[since I think it seems strange ]]. May they notice that I am here for other reasons and that I do not have connections with any other person in order to be free from concerns ... ... Harpokration
