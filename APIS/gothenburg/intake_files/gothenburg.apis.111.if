cu500_t | 1 | I and those with me are greeting you in the name of our Lord. Just as it is your duty to help all the brothers in the name of our Lord, you shall give your love to these sisters, too, who are brought to the epitropos, through what you will offer them. In the name of our Lord, I wish that you are well.
