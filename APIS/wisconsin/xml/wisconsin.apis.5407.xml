                           <ab type="conservation">A light-brown papyrus with dark stains, regularly cut off on all sides. There is an upper margin of 2 cm. ; below column I there is an open space varying between 2.5 and 3.5 cm., below column II there is an open space varying between 13 and 14 cm. (at the right-hand side the lines slope upwards). At least one more column must have been written before column I (traces of this text are still visible at the level of lines 7 and 9 of column I). The text has been mutilated in a few places by holes, especially at the folds (12 vertical ones). Lines 8, 18, 19, 24 and 25 are indented; line 9 is shorter than the others. In a few places there is a small space where a new sentence begins. On the recto side the text runs parallel to the fibers and on the verso side against the fibers. The verso side would seem to have been used before.</ab>
