                  <summary>The papyrus is a will of the type usual in Oxyrhynchos. In this will, Taptollion bequeathes her possessions, consisting of a share in three plots of land and certain things she has inherited in part from her father, and in part from her mother, to the two brothers Harmiusis and Amois, sons of Horos, grandsons of Pelux. It is not possible to determine the relationship, if any, between the testatrix���s possessions will go to her next of kin.</summary>

                     <p>Approx. 70 letters are missing at the left-hand side, where the text is broken off at a fold (the papyrus has 1 vertical and 6 horizontal folds). The preserved text, running against the fibers, as is the case with many wills, is mutilated by holes in the left-hand part. The handwriting of those who have signed indicates that they were not accustomed to writing, with the exception of the fifth hand the text itself is written very legibly in small, upright letters. Demopoios��� handwriting bespeaks a skilled hand.</p>

            <ab>Imperial year] the 26th of the month of Neos Sebastos in the town of Oxyrhynchos in the Thebais for good fortune. This is the last will made in the street by me, Taptollion, [daughter of N.N.,] son of Ptollion [ his mother being N.N.] from the village of Phthochis, normal and in possession of all my faculties having as guardian my nephew Harmiusis, son of Nechthnikis, grandson of Ptollion his mother [N.N.] . As long as I am still alive, I have complete power over my own possession to make further stipulations concerning them and to make other provisions concerning them, whichever I want to, and to make this will null and void, and whatever I stipulate will be valid. But id I die without this will being altered, I leave behind as my heirs Harmiusis, alias pelx. And Amois, both sons of Horos, son of Pelux, his mother being Irene [both from the town of Oxyrhynchos           ,] each of them, if he is alive, if not, his children, as equivalent heir to the third part of two and a half and one-fourth arurae belonging to me in the vicinity of Posompus Aristomachu and to the third part [of          ] arurae [and         ] of two arurae in the vicinity of Phthochis and to the appurtenances of my father���s (property) on the one hand to the remainder of my mother���s (property?) on the other hand and to all other things, which I leave behind in whatever way. Should one of them die without children and without a will, his portion of my estate shall belong to the other; should the other one, which God forbid, also die without children and without a will, it shall not be contested that one of my next of kin shall benefit, and absolutely no-one shall be allowed to violate one of these stipulations, or else, without affecting the validity of these stipulations, the person who tries to make any part of these things invalid shall pay to the person who observes these stipulations, a fine of thousand drachmas and an equal sum to the public treasury. The will is valid.

Should one of them die without children and without a will, his portion of the inheritance shall belong to the other; should the other one also die without children and without a will, it shall not be contested that one of my next of kin shall inherit my possessions, as is written above. I am 35 years old without any distinguishing marks and my seal shows the image of Agathos Daimon and the Good Fortune. I, Harmiusis, son of Nechthenikis, grandson of Ptollion, add myself to this, as my niece���s guardian and I am . . years old without any distinguishing marks.
