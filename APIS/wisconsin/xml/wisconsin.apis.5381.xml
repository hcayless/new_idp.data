The hire for the whole year is four hundred and twenty silver drachmas, which I, Achillas, shall pay to Glaukios without delay in monthly installments at the end of the month, when the lease has been ratified. The female slave Tapontos will have four days off in the month of Tybi and in Pachon also four days, eight days in total, for which nothing will be deducted from the hire. But if she should be absent for more days either because of festival day or because of illness or on account of some imperious necessity on the part of her master, then the hire for those days will be deducted. If needs her during the night to bake bread her master will summon her, without anything being deducted from the hire. The lease is valid.
