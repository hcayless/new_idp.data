                  <summary>The situation described in this papyrus as follows: when the petitioner had to perform a certain liturgical duty, he didn���t refer to the honors = stephanoi, which had been awarded him for his services to the community and which he had dedicated in a temple. Together with his colleagues he did his utmost to fulfill the imposed liturgy. This being completed, he applied to the prefect, who granted him release from liturgies on account of his old age. A long time before he had already showed the praefect���s decree to those persons to whom the petition is addressed. Nevertheless he was nominated to equip the troops and twice at that. Because his powers of sight are failing and because he can���t carry the burden of the munera (personalia) any longer, he now asks the persons to whom he addresses this petition, to give attention to his request. He is also going to submit to them the written documents concerning the prefect���s decree. Yet, in spite of all this, the petitioner will continue his financial contributions to the liturgical expenses.</summary>

            <ab>- - - - - -  - - -] I have not taken advantage of the honorary crowns awarded to me, which lie even now in the shrine of Athene-Thoeris, the very great goddess, in our native town, but with my colleagues I have exerted myself with might and main, in order that they were finished. After that I went to the most illustrious deputy of the prefecture, Mussius Aemilianus, and received in reply the humanity of the laws as regards my no longer being troubled in connection with liturgies, because I have grown old-for I have already reached full eighty-three years-and long ago I have seen to it, right from the start, that those things which his greatness had thought fit, were made clear to you and even now I continue to do so through the strategus��� servant, but afterwards I was appointed to see to the equipment of the most brave soldiers that were sent to Lower Egypt; ( I was appointed to see to) other (provisionings) for the after [       ] added [      ] and this, too, I have fulfilled, but now I ask and request you because you see that I am not and have grown weak of sight, having besides copies of that which was instructed by our lord the most illustrious Mussius Aemilianus, which I shall also show you now, as regards troubling me no more in connection with liturgies, because I am not able and am weak of body, but I shall contribute [           ] to expenses.</ab>
