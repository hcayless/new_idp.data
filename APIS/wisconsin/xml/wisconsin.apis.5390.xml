                  <summary>The papyrus deals with the division of the estate of the deceased trooper Valens between his wife and two fellow-soldiers, who had lent him money. Valens��� possessions, which are still in the army camp, have first to be collected. After they have been sold, the proceeds will be divided into four equal parts, after deduction of three legacies and debts still outstanding with other money-lenders. If, after all the deductions have been made, the possessions of the deceased should yield more than 1260 drachmas, Aemilius, having the most claims, will receive 60 drachmas plus an extra sum on top of his two parts. What is left after the 1260 drachmas + 60 drachmas + drachmas have been deducted. Will be divided pro rato between the three (four, when taking into account that Aemilius gets two parts) parties.</summary>

            <ab>The year 15 of Imperator Caesar Trajanus Hadrianus Augustus, 21 Pachon in the camp of Syene of Thebais. Asklepias, daughter of Dadas, having as guardian Pindaros, son of Harsynios, heiress to her own husband Valens, deceased trooper of the cohort II of the Thracians from the turma Kartiliane and Aemilius, also trooper of the same cohort, because he is absent acting through his representative Julius Apollinarius, trooper armorum custos of the ala Gallika and Cassianus Gemellus curator of the turma Kartiliane, money-lenders to the same Valens, have come to the agreement, agreeing among themselves, that from all the possessions of Valens, which he had in the military camp, sought together and gathered and sold and being deducted with (the amount) for his batman and the legacy for Pamonios, his representative, and what (debts) he had previously and apart from the legacy of a hundred and forty-four drachmas, which Asklepias will take, from the remaining rest Asklepias takes one part as inheritance and for the care of his body and Aemilius, for that which is due to him, two parts and Kassianos, also for that which is due to him, the remaining fourth part. If one of the moneylenders should incur extra expenses or if Pamonios, the representative, should have to break into his legacy in one way or another, they will give that back too, pro rato to what they have received. if the goods to be divided should exceed one thousand and sixty drachmas, that which is written I the above agreement will remain valid, but sixty (drachmas) and an extra portion will fall to Aemilius. If there should be even more than sixty (drachmas) it will be divided in four parts, as they have received, over the three. The deleted loan-contracts will be given to Asklepias. It is written three times and each has taken a (copy). I, Asklepias, daughter of Dedas, agree with that which is written above and I have taken one part of the inheritance and I shall see to the care of Valens��� body [ . . . . . .  .</ab>
