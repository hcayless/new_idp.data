                  <summary>This papyrus contains a property return, following the customary lay-out. It is addressed to the full range of officials to whom these returns are usually sent in the villages of the Fayum: the strategus Theon; the basilikos grammateus Artemidoros; the village scribe Heras and the laographoi, two of whom, not occurring elsewhere, are referred to by name. Ptolemaiosâ€™ sister states that she owns a house in Theadelphia, acquired by purchase and that it is inhabited by her brother Ptolemaios, also acting as her guardian, together with his wife and son. She also owns property in the village of Apias and has returned this as well.</summary>
