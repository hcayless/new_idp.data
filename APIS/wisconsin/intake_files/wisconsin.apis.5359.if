cu520 | 1 | Various documents, written in Latin by one and the same person, who was clearly a skilled scribe. The nature of the entries can be established in a few cases. Lines 1-3 refer to a manumissio; lines 10-15 deal with the testatio of an illegitimate child; in lines 20-22 mention is made of a marriage; lines 23-32 (or lines 27-32) could be dealing with a credio (acceptance of an inheritance), while lines 33-41 semm again to be concerned with a manumissio.;We seem to be dealing with a collection of diverse documents. They may have been put together on purpose, e.g. to serve as evidence in connection with a law-suit; it is even possible that they all bear upon the same person(s). The other possibility is that they were written on an empty piece of papyrus as some kind of exercise. It is unlikely that it is a text sui iuris in view of the diversity of the recognizable documents and the absence of an addressee (this person may have been mentioned in the part lost at the left-hand side, though).;The assumption that a scribe used an empty piece of papyrus to practise certain formulae is based on:;1. the fact that the text written on the recto is probably a draft;;2. the number of corrections in the text (particularly lines 11 and 14, which are interlinear in actual fact;3. the diversity of the texts;4. the arrangement of the different texts on the papyrus;5. the appearance of the Greek words between lines 8 and 10.

cu590_con | 1 | A greyish papyrus, written across the fibers on the back of another text (P.Wisc. II 48). We do not know how much has been lost at the left-hand side. To the right of lines33-41 not many letters seem to be missing. Line 39 is even complete at the right hand side (but being the end of a section the text could have stopped anywhere).
