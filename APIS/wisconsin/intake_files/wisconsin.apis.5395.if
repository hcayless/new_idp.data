cu500_lin | 1 | 18 lines
cu500_pal | 1 | The text runs parallel to the fibers. The unskilled hand sometimes leaves large spaces between the letters of one single word. The papyrus, tapering towards the bottom, is only damaged by a few holes, but the text is difficult to read because the ink of some words has run. Also on the verso side there are ink traces visible, probably due to it having lain on top of another papyrus that had not yet completely dried.

cu590_con | 1 | A light-brown papyrus with dark stain; cut off straight at the left-hand side and at the top. At the top there is a margin left of 1.5 cm., at the left one of 1 cm. and at the bottom one of 5 cm. The lines on the right run up to the very edge. There is a kollesis ca. 2 cm. from the edge at the right. Two vertical folds are still visible. The papyrus has been used before and there are still traces of letters discernible, especially in the lefty-hand margin, which do not belong to the present text.
