cu520 | 1 | The papyrus is a declaration, written on June 3, A.D. 116 and registered on June 27. It is direceted to the keepers of the "bibliotheke egkteseon" (property-register office) of the Arsinoite nome, to the efefct that Isarous has given her slave Sarapias to another woman, whose name has been lost (line 130, as a security for a loan of 456 drachmas which she has received from this woman. The papyrus has been crossed out (invalidated), thus making the document null and void. We may assume that Isarous only bregistered her slave because she had to give her as a security for a loan.
