cu520 | 1 | Aristandros, whose function can‚ÇÖt be ascertained, but who is certain to have been higher in rank than the ephodoi as he can issue this order, tells the ephodoi of Psobthis to arrest three men he has sent away (either from imprisonment or as officials, concerning whom facts have come to light to justify their arrest) if they meet them. From this last addition it may perhaps be inferred that similar orders have also been sent to other places.
