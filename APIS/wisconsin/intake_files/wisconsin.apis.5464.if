cu500_pal | 1 | The text runs parallel to the fibers. Traces of a washed-off text, running against the fibers, are visible on the verso side. The first hand, writing large letters and leaving a wide space between the lines, is well-trained and makes his lines, which slope down towards the right, reach up to the very edge. The second hand, writing small letters close together and bespeaking great skill, does not endeavor to make his lines, which slope upwards towards the right, run up to the edge.

cu500_t | 1 | Aelius Heraclitus to Apollonius, shore guard, my most beloved, greetings. I had not expected that a petition would reach me concerning the brushwood for you to supply the adequate amount of water as Ptolemaios, the leaseholder thereof has requested me. It fell to your care, did it not, before he requested, to see to this as well. If up to now anything has acted impedingly or anything else of the things which seemed to you to be more urgent, caused delay in filling the brushwood, then see now to it, brother that the usual amount of water is supplied to it. I pray that you are inn good health, my most beloved. Year 8 of Antoninus, the 7th Hathyr.

cu520 | 1 | Ptolemaios, the leaseholder of the plot of land bearing various kinds of brushwood, had up to 7th Hathyr, not received sufficient water for his drymos. Consequently he wrote a letter on this matter to Aelius Heraclitus (the name Aelius would seem to indicate that he or his father was imperial freedman), the assistant of procurator usiacus, to inform him of the situation and to obtain his co-operation to prevail upon the aigialophlax, who is, among other things, charged with the distribution and supply of water, that he will still receive the usual amount of water and secure compensation in case of damage.
