cu590_con | 1 | A light-brown papyrus, neatly cut off at the top and left-hand side. At the top there is a margin left of 1.5 cm., at the left-hand side of the first receipt one of 1.5 cm. and at the left of the second receipt one of 2.5 cm.; between the first and the second receipts there is a space of 2 cm.; the margin at the bottom can no longer be determined because of the mutilations. The text is extremely difficult to read due to fading and mutilations at the folds (one vertical fold is still visible; it is evident that the papyrus has been folded horizontally several times in different ways). Attached to this papyrus was a fragment (2 x 3 cm.), which on account of its color and structure must have been part of this papyrus and on which indecipherable traces of one line of text are still visible. This fragment must have been attached further to the right (there is an open space of 1.5 cm. before the traces) either at the level of line 9 or line 16(there is an open space of 1.5 cm. below the traces).
