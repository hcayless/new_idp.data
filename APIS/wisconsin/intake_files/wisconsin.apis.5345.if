cu653 | 1 | Bousiris: Dizionario Suppl.  1o (1935-1986)  considers it as a  the city in the Delta (entried under no 2 of Calderinis&apos;s Dizionario). However, it should be very peculiar to have a papyrus from this area. On the other hand the noun "kome" (village) mentioned in the papyrus points to either to the village in the Arsinoite nome  or the village in the Herakleopolite nome. Since concerning the former there is no attestation of the noun "kome", the latter assumption is better. For this village in the Herakleopolite nome see M.R Falivene, The Herakleopolite nome, ASP 37, 1998, pp. 60-64 (NL)
