cu500_t | 1 | Pausiris, son of Ammonios and Apollonios, son of Apollonios, weaver, have agreed between them that Pausiris has bound his son Dioskus, who is still under age, apprentice to Apollonios in order to learn the whole weaver‚ÇÖs trade, as he also knows it himself, for the period of one year from the present day, whilst he shall perform and do everything which he is told to do. Apollonios has received for the boy, who is clothed and dressed by the weaver for the duration of the whole period, fourteen drachmas for clothing and Pausiris shall give him five silver drachmas a month for his food. And the said Pausiris, the father,, must not take the boy away from the master within the period. If he does not perform all the tasks, he must pay the master one silver drachma for each day that he does not do his duty or he shall send him to stay on the equal number of days and the penalty for taking the boy away within the period agreed on is a hundred drachmas and an equal sum to the treasury. Should the master fail to instruct the boy, he shall pay the same fine. The indenture is valid. The thirteenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator,  [ . (.)] Thoth [ . . . . . .

cu520 | 1 | Although Pausiris was a master of the weaver‚ÇÖs trade so that he could take apprentices, he apprenticed his own sons to other weavers. This procedure might be occasioned by a law prohibiting a father to take his own son as apprentice. This phenomenon might just as well point to a vast specialization in the trade or might be explained on psychological grounds.
