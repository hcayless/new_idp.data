cu500_t | 1 | Didymos to Hephaistion my lord brother greetings. As our very good brother Phabanon writes to you we very much rejoiced and had a party when we reveived your letter. All our people are well and even more so after they received your letter. Therefore do it without delay knowing that this is our expectation. Phabanon wrote to you about everything also about the mixed produce. Nothing has been done about that because Theon will tell you in person how cheap it is. Hurry quickly and come to us as you wrote. All the persons in the house greet you. Buy a tunic for Thermuthis, she has nothing to put on. Receive the suit from theon the most honoured. I pray for your good health, worthy lord.;To Hephaistion, secretary of Philonikos, strategos of the Oxyrhynchite nome.
