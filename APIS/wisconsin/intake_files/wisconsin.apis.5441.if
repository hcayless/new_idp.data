cu520 | 1 | The Wisconsin part of this papyrus (lines 33-40; 74-79; 108-113; 172-180) was originally published by G. Malz, Another Zenon Papyrus at the University of Wisconsin, AJA 39 (1935), pp. 373-376 (= SB V 7686).;At least one line has been lost between lines 32 and 33 (there may have also been a blank space of one line preceding the account for Tybi). More than one line may have been lost between lines 72 and 74 (the upper edge of column II of P.Wisc. inv. 2 is blank). One or two lines and a blank space must have been lost between lines 107 and 108, while between lines 171 and 172 again a few lines seem to be missing. ;Lines 112 and 113 seem to be written by a different hand. For the hands on the verso cf. PCZ III 59328, 116-160 note and G. Malz, loc. cit.
