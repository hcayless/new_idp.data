cu500_pal | 1 | The text, which is mutilated in a few places due to the folds and fading, or is difficult to read, runs parallel to the fibers. The document consists of two parts, written in the same hand (thicker pen has been used in the second part and the ink is of a darker color). The hand is clearly well-trained.

cu520 | 1 | The papyrus contains a sum, arranged by a daily order, of artabas of wheat received. In fragment A the bookings are indeed made from day to day, but in columns I and II of fragment B certain days are not represented by entries (because the sitologoi didn‚ÇÖt receive anything on these days?)the question arises whether we are dealing here with a private book-keeping of the sitologoi or with an account sent to the strategus.
