cu518 | 1 | Provenance Unknown
cu520 | 1 | Diogas inherited from his father, Diogenes, a house, that his father had mortgaged to a certain Horion. Diogas didn‚ÇÖt register the house with the bibliotheke enkteseon together with the other goods inherited from his father because it was still in the possession of Horion at the time and because he either intended (or was obliged by contract) to repay the loan only on 30th Mesore of the 8th yea (probably of Antoninus Pius) when he would acquire the house. Only then would he register the house as well. He has redeemed the loan at an earlier date; Horion has sent him a receipt for this through the bank used by Diogas; an official copy (viz. Signed by the scribe of the bank) of this receipt on a separate sheet of papyrus is now sent by Diogas to the bibliotheke enkteseon in order to have the distraint ended that had been levied on the house at the request of Horion, as a security for the loan. Diogas swears by the emperor that he has given a truthful statement of affairs. The dating of the document is followed by Diogas‚ÇÖs signature.
