cu500_t | 1 | Kaikillis Gemellos (Caecilius Gemellus) to Didymarion his sister and lady, very many greetings. Before anything else I pray for your good health and that of your children - may the evil eye not touch them -. I want you to know, sister, that I arrived (safely) at the barracks on the 20th of Pharmouthi. On the way Nepotilla met me and informed me that you did not hear about Sambathion. Your son behaved badly in not informing you at New Year about what he heard when he was here. Send me please, sister, when you have enough olives, (some of them) through your son, if he comes, if not buy them for me at the current price. I ask you, sister, write me quickly about your welfare and that of your children.Greet all your people and all the persons of your household.  I pray for your health.

cu520 | 1 | Kaikilios Gemellos (Caecilius Gemellus), a soldier, writes to his sister, who is probably his wife that he has safely arrived at the barracks. As the papyrus is damaged along the folds by two large holes, it is no longer possible to ascertain what he wrote in lines 11-16. He says something about a journey downstream, about a certain Sambathius (or Sambathion) (lines 13-15) and about Didymarion&apos;s son (lines 16-17). He continues by asking Didymarion to send him some olives. The letter ends with the usual greeting formulae. ;On the evsro there are traces of 2 lines of the address which are too faint to be read.
