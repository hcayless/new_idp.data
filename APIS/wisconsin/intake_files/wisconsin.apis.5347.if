cu520 | 1 | The persons mentioned in this papyrus (men and women) paid certain amounts of corn, as we may deduce from the appearance of choinix, a dry measure for corn especially. We can no longer ascertain for what reason these payments were made. There is no order in the sequence of days. The names of the pesons and the number of artabas paid by them were probably copied from other documents (the receipts issued to the payers?) and they were transcribed as the writer found them. This papyrus may have served as a list to check who had paid and who had not. Possibly another list was made by means of this one, now arranged according to days. Not only men but women are listed.
