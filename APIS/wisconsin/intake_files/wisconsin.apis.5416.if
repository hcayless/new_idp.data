cu520 | 1 | Herakleia receives 3 1/2 artabas of wheat as her share of 8 1/2 arouras in the vicinity of Polydeukeia. In the cases of leases of land it is generally the lessor (- owner) who pays the taxes. From the fact that Saolis is paying the artab tax it may be inferred that he and Herakleia had the 8 1/2 arouras in common ownership. the share received by Herakleia is small but not without a parallel.
