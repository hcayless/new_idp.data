cu500_t | 1 | From Anoup and Abraamios of Tarouthinos came accusing Eirene because she conducted a channel to their land though of old they need not allow this. Let your Excellency arrange it that each has his own land and if they have to allow that she conducts the channel (to their land) and nobody hindered her of old (then they will not object) but if at no time this channel was conducted (to their land) let it now also not be allowed to this woman.;verso: Deliver to his Excellency  Ioannes, assistant of TArouthinos from Anoup and Abraamios

cu520 | 1 | The language of the text is not all that lucid, yet it is possible to understand what the text is about. A certain woman Eirene has conducted an irrigation-channel to the land of Anoup and Abraamios with probably most unpleasant results. Anoup and Abraamios request the assistant of their (?) village to look into the matter and to decide if Eirene has the right to act as she told.;It is quite well possible that this papyrus belongs to the archive of the family of Apiones. We know that there was a conncetion between Tarouthinos and his family. The names Anoup and Abraamios are often found in documents pertaining to this family (though both names are common). In P.Oxy. XVI 2032, which belongs to the papers of this family, money is paid by an assistant Ioannes.
