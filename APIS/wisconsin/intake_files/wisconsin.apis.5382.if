I have voluntarily leased for two years from the present 19th year of our rulers for fishing [      ] and from others the waters round Tholthis of the middle-toparchy, while seventy-seven silver drachmas have been agreed on as a part of the rent and while also two jars of thrissa and six jars of garum have been agreed on. When the lease has been, ratified for me, I shall give the lessor the sum of money at the catch, but the two jars of thrissa and the six jars of garum I shall give to be taken away immediately. If the agreement is not sanctioned, I shall not be bound by the promise.
