cu500_t | 1 | Ptolemaios to Kassianos, his brother, very many greetings. Before anything else I pary for your health. I have received one keramion --- and a letter in which you write that you had come ---. At the same time you could have come up-country to us so that we too --- because it is sweet to greet you in person. If he wants you to come in good health another time I implore you to come up-country to me. If I find someone who can bring you Proklous (Proclus)&apos;s money I will send it through him, if not, if Longinos (Longinus) has not departed, you will speak to him with my words and you will take it from him and write to me through him and I will give him here hundred and twenty-four drachmas. Greet Sarapias and her mother and Baukalas and all your people, each by name. I pray for your health, lord. Mecheir 17.

cu520 | 1 | Ptolemaios has received a letter from his brother Kassianos Gemellos  (Cassianus Gemellus) informing him that his brother had been in the neighbouhood. He more or less blames Kassianos for not coming up-country and paying him a visit. Ptolemaios urges Kassianos not to fail to visit him next time he comes his brother&apos;s way. He promises to send a sum of money to Kassianos. If he cannot find someone to take it to Kassianos, Ptolemaios will pay Longinus back in the place where he lives, situated south of Karanis.
