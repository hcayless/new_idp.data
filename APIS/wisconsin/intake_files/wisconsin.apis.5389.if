cu500_pal | 1 | Approx. 70 letters are missing at the left-hand side, where the text is broken off at a fold (the papyrus has 1 vertical and 6 horizontal folds). The preserved text, running against the fibers, as is the case with many wills, is mutilated by holes in the left-hand part. The handwriting of those who have signed indicates that they were not accustomed to writing, with the exception of the fifth hand the text itself is written very legibly in small, upright letters. Demopoios‚ÇÖ handwriting bespeaks a skilled hand.

As long as I am still alive, I have complete power over my own possession to make further stipulations concerning them and to make other provisions concerning them, whichever I want to, and to make this will null and void, and whatever I stipulate will be valid. But id I die without this will being altered, I leave behind as my heirs Harmiusis, alias pelx. And Amois, both sons of Horos, son of Pelux, his mother being Irene [both from the town of Oxyrhynchos           ,] each of them, if he is alive, if not, his children, as equivalent heir to the third part of two and a half and one-fourth arurae belonging to me in the vicinity of Posompus Aristomachu and to the third part [of          ] arurae [and         ] of two arurae in the vicinity of Phthochis and to the appurtenances of my father‚ÇÖs (property) on the one hand to the remainder of my mother‚ÇÖs (property?) on the other hand and to all other things, which I leave behind in whatever way. Should one of them die without children and without a will, his portion of my estate shall belong to the other; should the other one, which God forbid, also die without children and without a will, it shall not be contested that one of my next of kin shall benefit, and absolutely no-one shall be allowed to violate one of these stipulations, or else, without affecting the validity of these stipulations, the person who tries to make any part of these things invalid shall pay to the person who observes these stipulations, a fine of thousand drachmas and an equal sum to the public treasury. The will is valid. I, Taptollion, [daughter of N.N.,] son of Ptollion, have made the will, on the grounds of which I, when I die, leave behind Harmius, alias Pelux and Amois, sons of Horos, son of Pelux, as my heirs to the third part of two and a half and one-fourth arurae belonging to me in the vicinity of Posompus Artistomachu and to the third part [of             ] arurae [and          ] of two arurae in the vicinity of Phthochis and to the appurtenances of my father‚ÇÖs (property?) on the one hand and to the remainder of my mother‚ÇÖs (property?) and to all other things, whichever I leave behind. Should one of them die without children and without a will, his portion of the inheritance shall belong to the other; should the other one also die without children and without a will, it shall not be contested that one of my next of kin shall inherit my possessions, as is written above.
