cu500_t | 1 | Diotimos to Isarous greetings. I have recived from Aigialos as a first allowance for Aphrodite 22 dr. and as a second allowance 24 dr. also from Aigialos, as a third allowance 24 dr. and as a fifth allowance you have sent 12 dr. of wool and I have received from Aigialos the remaining 12 dr. so that I have the fifth allowance up to Choiach of the 13th year of Domitianus the lord and you have sent me through Heraklas a chiton worth 24 dr. so that I have it up to Pharmouthi. Greet your children and your husband. Aphrodite greets all of you. Greet your mother and all your people. Farewell. Hathyr 21.;verso: To Theadelphia to Isarous concerning the allowance of Aphrodite.

cu520 | 1 | The chief interest of this private letter is to be found that it provides us with an exactly dated letter from the first century A.D. Aphrodite who is staying with a certain Diotimos receives an allowance from her family. This allowance is paid six times. Diotimos reports that he received Aphrodite&apos;s allowance up till Pharmouthi. It is probably a coincidence that Choiach is the end of the first period of the Egyptian year and Pharmouthi the end of the second period. As this letter was written in Hathyr and it is unlikely that the payments were made in advance, this papyrus should in all probability be dated November 17, A.D. 94.
