In order now that we, too, can get the water forthwith and benefit and cultivate all our land and can pay the state-taxes for this and the annona and all kinds of extra charges we submit this document to you, requesting that you, by means of your servants, inform the most exalted council through the prytanis in office, Aurelius Kastorion, in order that it (the council) carry out an inspection, making an estimate of the states of the stream and which are covered with stones, situated in the village of Tanis of your nome, so that we too can benefit from the coming up of the flax and have drinkable water and sow the flat land of our village and stay in our own territory and have benefit from our own possessions. Farewell. The year 21 and 13 of our lords Diocletianus and Maximianus Augusti and Constantius and Maximianus the most illustrious Caesar, the 1st Pachon.

They complain about an inadequate water supply. The consequence is that they can‚ÇÖt cultivate their estates properly, which again results in large debts to the tameion, a consequence they cleverly emphasize. They set out recognising the prime importance of this treasury.
