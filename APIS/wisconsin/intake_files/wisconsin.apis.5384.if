cu500_pal | 1 | The text, which is badly mutilated, runs parallel with the fibers, both on the verso side and on the recto side. Everywhere the lines virtually continue to the sides. The second hand writes the consul-dating quite skillfully, but the handwriting of the rest of document indicates that the writer of this hand did not have much practice. The third hand, which also covers the verso side, displays the typical Byzantine manner of writing with large, flowing letters.

cu520 | 1 | The papyrus deals with renting an exhedra, a deal between two women from Oxyrhynchos. These women -and the frequency with which women are letting and renting is remarkable- are in all probability either Jewesses or come from a Jewish environment, as I would infer from the typically Jewish names Joseph and Daniel. This Joseph called his daughter Philoxenda. The wording used differs in no respect from the one customary in this type of document.
