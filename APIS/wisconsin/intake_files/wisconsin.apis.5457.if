cu500_pal | 1 | The document consists of two parts, written in the same hand (thicker pen has been used in the second part and the ink is of a darker color). The hand is clearly well-trained. The text, which is mutilated in a few places due to the folds and fading, or is difficult to read, runs parallel to the fibers.

cu520 | 1 | The papyrus contains a sum, arranged by a daily order, of artabas of wheat received. In fragment A the bookings are indeed made from day to day, but in columns I and II of fragment B certain days are not represented by entries (because the sitologoi didn‚ÇÖt receive anything on these days?)the question arises whether we are dealing here with a private book-keeping of the sitologoi or with an account sent to the strategus.
