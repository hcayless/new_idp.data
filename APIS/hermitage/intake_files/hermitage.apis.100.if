cu500_t | 1 | ...and do not let it become known to us that, as I've said, one single arura has been left without water in your district.  For, in accordance with God's command, we are going to send an envoy of ours to learn how you have been getting on with this, and nothing is going to escape our notice.  Strictly adhere to this advice, not giving rise to false accusation against you or scandal, but quickly send the yield that your district acquired on account of the store-houses of Babylon for the embole of the 9th indiction.  For we are not going to allow you to lag behind by one single artab.  Do not neglect what remains and do not encounter any danger.  Written on the 19th of Payni in the 9th indiction.
