cu500_t | 1 | Holy trinity, holy trinity, holy trinity.  Through the holy martyrs I pray to the Lord.  For even the angel is not ignorant of our suffering; thus bear witness to the fact that Theodosius has a tyrannical temper.  I have suffered utter adversity as a result of his tyrannical way, without finding aid, except for strength from the Lord and witness to me through the saints.  Through them I flee to you, and weeping I look to your holiness, in order to behold your might; how much malice he has done me.  For weeping(?), I have suffered utter evil at his hand.  Lord, do not disregard this and do not stand by him, this Theodosius, as I mentioned before; and do not neglect me, since alone the Lord is God, in the son and in the father and in the holy spirit, forever and ever. Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen. Lord, Lord, Lord . . .
