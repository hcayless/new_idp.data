cu500_t | 1 | I am writing, because there was a festival from the 26th until the 6th and the office of the aigialophylax was not occupied.  I am writing to you about the 7 staters, because I was laboring much to pursue Heraiskos and, after all, he gave me 24 drachmas, saying that the man deducted one stater.  I gave Heracleides, the secretary of the aigialophylax, 3 x 4 drachmas and received from him a document. . .
