cu500_t | 1 | Proklos sends many greetings to his dearest friend Tryphon.  Isidoros the bearer of this letter to you belongs to my household; he originates, however, from the village of Psophthis in the Memphite nome and pays his poll-tax and his other public dues there.  Now, after being arrested by your men he was forced to give a declaration under oath with regard to his cultivating five and a half arouras of revenue land near Philadelphia belonging to the estate of Livia.  I ask you therefore also on my account, if you care at all for my friendship, leave him undisturbed and take care that the declaration on oath be returned to him.  And by doing this you'll gratify me.  Farewell.  Year 35 of Caesar, Mecheir 25.
