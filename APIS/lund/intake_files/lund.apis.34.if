cu500_t | 1 | Recto: To my lord brother Leontios, Chrysaris, the daughter of Ambrosius, greeting. Be aware that I learned that you have been living in Narmouthis quite some time ago, and I did not want to come there to you because of the ejectment, even though I could also take with me Elias the baker who is my dependant and could collect from you. And many times the same Elias told me - I'm also going to get letters from the bishop or the vicarius to the councillors if they are going to collect from you.- And I did not want to for God's sake, lest you suffer ejectment. Please therefore send me the 2 solidi. If you want me to come there, write back to me, and I will come to you. If again you want to send me the half, 8,000 talents?, send it immediately, and the balance within a few days. I pray for your health for a long time, my lord. Verso: Deliver to Leontios the cumin seller from Chrysaris daughter of Ambrosios.
