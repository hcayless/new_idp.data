I went to Zoilas, son of Argaios, and he went to the office of the royal scribe and made investigation and did not find your name written in the roll. Well then, come rather quickly up to your home. Salute the children of Herennia, and Pompeis and Syrion and Thaïsous and her children and her husband and all my friends. Be of good health.;Verso:;Deliver from Charitous to Pompeius, her brother.
