cu500_t | 1 | Aurelius Philantinous to his father Aurelius Ploution very many greetings. Before all I pray for your health and I make supplication for you before the gods of this place.;Please would you be so kind, if you want (me?) to arrange the new enterprise for you and Lytus, to transmit the available (deposited) things? For I have made sixteen deliveries for each of you, so that you have thirtytwo together, the price of which, at the rate of twelve drachmae, will be 384 drachmae in all. So if you want (me?) to do that, you must send the available ..., together with a letter, in order that I may serve you early. I submit myself to you now at once, so as not to neglect anything, but if you do not send them ... I have proved to be without reproach.
