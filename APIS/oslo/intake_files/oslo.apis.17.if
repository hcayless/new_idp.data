cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus was bought with the date beneath the text cut off. L Amundsen&apos;s remark: "Of this letter I saw the lower half, containing the valediction and date (by emperor&apos;s year, month, days) on the recto, and prob. end of address on the verso, in the hands of Ali Mahmud; the price he asked for the box of fragments in which this was placed, was too high."
