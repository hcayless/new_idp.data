cu500_t | 1 | SB VIII 9668: "and the basis of complaint is not the same for each of you. For some of you are legionary veterans and some from the cohorts, some from the alae, some from the oarsmen group so that the legal right is not the same for all. I shall take care of it. I have written to the strategoi of the nomes to instruct them to abide by the terms of the imperial constitution as to the rights of each of you."

cu520 | 1 | Official letter concerning honeste missi (missikii), written from some higher official. Mention of strategoi. At the end four crosses (XXXX) in the middle of the line, signifying perhaps "forty"? According to Daris S  P.Oslo inv.1451 and P.Fouad 21, l. 11-16 are identical in expression and are perhaps copies of the same document, and SB VIII 9668  prints Daris&apos; new version of the text and describes it as an "Official document concerning the legal position of  dismissed soldiers".
