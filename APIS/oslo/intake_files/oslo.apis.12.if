cu500_t | 1 | Herennia to Pompeius ... very many greetings and all good wishes for his health, and I salute my mother. I beg you to remind my father to buy a coloured, decent outer garment. Let yourself be satisfied (paid) ... the house ... with the price of the garment ... the Arsinoite. Don&apos;t forget to buy (another, similar to?) the coloured one for Pration. Receive two measures of lentils from Thaisous. And Antiphanes wrote me in order that there may be sale there ... I ask you to send me three staters of parrot-cloth for headbands. Pompeis junior sends his regards to you, his father and mother. We send our regards to your children and those at home.;      April 1st;(With her own hand:) Be of good health.
