cu500_t | 1 | Dionysios to his dearest Theon, very many greetings and for ever good health. When you reminded me of buying fish, I asked a friend of mine to buy 60 pigfishes for a drachma. I gave them to the person who came from you. But he himself bought 30 fishes for a drachma. I also gave him a basket. See to it that he does not cheat you, as he usually cheats in business affairs. When he himself made a buy, he only got 30 fishes, but 60 for you.;And send me five artabas of beans instead of lentils.;By the way, take care of yourself so that you are well.;Give greetings to all of yours, and to Herakles, son of Petalos. Goodbye. ;In the Emperor&apos;s 30th year, 30. Mesore. - And the basket, send it to me with Androus.;Verso:;Give to Theonas
