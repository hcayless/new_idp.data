cu500_t | 1 | [---] Stotoetis, an ibis-burier from Pso [--] has [written ?] to us [contending?] that you have [admitted?] a certain woman into the Tharesieion, though Stotoetis objected that she had no claim to (anything in) the temple. I am therefore surprised that [you] have ordered such a thing -- without attending to the rules of the temples. You will therefore do well to let Stotoetis in peace in the temple and, if the woman makes any objection, to send her to the town in order to be judged against Stotoetis by myself and the priests. [Farewell, year.] 1, Mecheir 13.
