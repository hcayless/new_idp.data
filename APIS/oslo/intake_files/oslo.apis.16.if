cu500_t | 1 | Heron to his most honoured Didymos greeting. The chief secretary Ptolemaios wrote to me that I ask you to go to Dionysias and buy covers for the tripods in the triclinium and, since it is a particular friend (of his) who has ordered this, to send them to him. I wrote to you knowing that you would do it. ..... Do it faster please, as your friend troubles us with his perpetual requests. I suppose his request will not be a burden to you since he is your friend. I also send you the letter from him. I pray that you are well, my lord.;Verso: To Didymos from Heron.
