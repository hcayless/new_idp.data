cu590_con | 1 | Now a nearly square papyrus, cut neatly through Column II, along present right edge. The papyrus was apparently folded three times vertically and subsenquently mended along the resultant splits with thread. According to H.I.Bell&apos;s inventory, this work was done in antiquity (the only example he had seen). The surface is much damaged and abraded, but all sides exept the right are nominally complete.
