cu500_pal | 1 | The text has been written in black ink against the fibres. The recto side, which is courser in texture and darker in colour, preserves nothing but two ink stains. For all its clumsiness, the hand that has penned the note betrays a certain familiarity with scribal practice. The letter forms, of medium (towards small) module, predominantly rounded and formed neatly at a good pace, exhibit a certain, though not perfectly accomplished, degree of stability. Perhaps written by an apprentice with a scriptorium.
