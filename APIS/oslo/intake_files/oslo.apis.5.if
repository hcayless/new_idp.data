cu500_t | 1 | Aurelius Philantinous to his father Aurelius Ploution very many greetings. Before all I pray for your health and I make supplication for you before the gods of this place.;I told you before through my son Psenteus about your and Lytus&apos; interests, but (I have heard?) nothing at all about your deliveries; if you really want (me?) to arrange matters for you, you must send the available (deposited) things. For I have made sixteen deliveries for each of you, that makes thirtytwo, the cost of which, at the rate of twelve drachmae, amounts to 384 drachmae. And the loan for the new rolls I have had entered in the books, about which we have got your affirmation. I write to you in order that, if you neglect it, I shall not be blameworthy in your eyes. I greet all of our family. I pray for your health.
