cu590_con | 1 | The beginning of the document is lost, and a number of letters have been lost or damaged along a vertical fold. Breakage lines in the papyrus indicate that it was folded twice vertically. Pressure on the folded edge seems to have caused a downward displacement of the middle of lines 9-12. As a result the middle of line 12 is partly hidden beneath line 13.
