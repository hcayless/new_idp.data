            <ab>To the strategos. . .  from Thaesis, daughter of Kh-, from Philadelphia. I have already submitted to you an application against Tesenouphis, treasury-guard of the private [l. 5] treasury of Antiphilos alleging that when I asked for them Tesenouphis denied that I had deposited with him in the granary 293 artabas of wheat and had made an agreement with him thereby he would return them in the [l. 10] 27th year, and [sc. I submitted the application] desiring to arrest the man.  I had agreed [sc. to the terms of the deposit] and he had written a [confirmatory] letter to the toparch X son of Ptolemaios owner of a 100 arouras allotment [l. 15] in whose name I cultivate the plot.  You wrote to Sarapion, superintendent of police.  He arrested him since he was an acknowledged defaulter in returning the deposit. When I appealed to you, you ordered Sarapion to produce the man, [l. 20] but since he has not produced him, I ask you that when you are in the circuit to help me compel Sarapion to produce the man so that I may receive [l. 25] justice.  Be well. [hand 2] . . . Epeiph charge concerning the deposit  . . .  I order that . . . to her . . . the remaining 293 artabas of wheat . . . [l. 30] in the year 27th . . .</ab>
