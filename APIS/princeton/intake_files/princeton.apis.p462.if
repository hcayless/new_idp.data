cu500_t | 1 | Eumelos to Ammonios, his most honored friend, many greetings. Before everything else I pray that you are in good health, and I make obeisance for you before the lord Sarapis.  You will do well [l. 5] if in the event that the mother of Dioskoros comes to you, you receive her and deliver to her the rents of parcels of land . . . I swear by all the gods that this is not why she comes, but to solve your obligation and so that nobody would give [l. 10] you trouble on my behalf, and if you have given anything to the collectors out of the house-rents, settle the account with her.  I salute by name you children, whom the evil eye shall not harm, and your wife, and everyone in your house.  Dioskoros and Sarapis salute you.   [l. 15] Convey greetings to Kanis and his wife and his children.
