cu500_t | 1 | To my father and lord Eulogios, Theodoulos sends greetings.  Another time when I came [l. 5] to you along with my brother Nikon for Euantheia and for hemp, which [l. 10] you owe me, you then asked me to allow you to wait for a few days until [l. 15] we meet and you return the hemp.  I am astonished since two months have passed as of today and you did not return the hemp to me.  For you should know that it is not [l. 20] mine, but belongs to my master.  I have asked therefore that you deliver the hemp to my brother Kolokairos [added in diff. hand] and Painiskos.  I pray you be well for [l. 25] all time.  Or, you can give to them the price value of the hemp.
