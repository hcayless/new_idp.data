cu090 | 1 | Oxy. 1371
cu500 | 1 | Written on both sides of the papyrus
cu500 | 2 | Verso: 6 lines text, 16 lines scholia, broken left and bottom;
cu500 | 3 | Recto: 11 lines text, 9 lines
cu500 | 4 | Except for phi which extends above and below the line, the hand is bilinear and slopes slightly to the right
cu500 | 5 | The glosses are written in black ink, rather than the brown ink of the text
cu500 | 6 | Accents and breathings inserted by two hands: ll. 1-11, 38 in a second hand, ll. 39-48 in the hand of the original scribe
cu500 | 7 | On the recto are glosses in the left-hand margin
cu500 | 8 | In the upper margin, (recto), are some brief notes on line 52 written in a lighter ink and a different hand
cu500 | 9 | A correction in the order of words in line 47 is probably later than the glosses in the margin, and was written by the writer of the notes in the upper margin
cu500 | 10 | Line 1 appears at the top of a column, so it is likely that Clouds is the first play in this manuscript

cu510_dd | 12 | P.Oxy.:11:1371
