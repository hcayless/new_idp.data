On the night leading up to the 18th of Pharmouthi, in the 42nd year of Caesar, shepherds from the village, having assaulted the [l. 10] royal land that is farmed by me, destroyed half an aroura of hay.  I request, therefore, if it seems right, that you have the accused [l. 15] brought to you for future proceedings. Farewell.
