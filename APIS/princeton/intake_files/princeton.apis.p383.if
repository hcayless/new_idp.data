cu520 | 7 | Edicts of a prefect whose name has been lost.  The first concerns the customs/tax collectors who were reported to be seeking unjustly to exact money from transient visitors. Those of their victims whose time was short were seized, with the result that many offered to purchase their freedom in order to secure a speedier release.  The edict orders an immediate cessation of these practices.  A fragment of a second edict, written in a second hand, is attached
