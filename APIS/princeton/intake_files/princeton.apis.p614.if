cu500_t | 1 | To Aurelius Apollonius, also called Hierax, strategos of the Herakleides division of the Arsinoite nome from Aurelius Asoeis, son of Pauseris from the village of [l. 5] Philadelphia concerning my brother Atammon residing in the village of Kaminou.  Since during the raid on us of the Lybians my brother [l. 10] Atammon yesterday fell from the roof of the house, which my brother owns in the same village.  He is in critical condition and has numerous fractures, [l 15] and therefore since he is in critical condition, I am supplying this petition asking to have it registered in case the human thing happens to him [i.e. in case my brother dies].   Be well. [l. 20] Asoeis, 40 years old, with a scar on the left shin.  The 6th year of the Emperors Caesars Publius Licinnius Valerianus and Publius Licinnius Valerianus Gallienus, Germanici Maximi [l. 25] Pii Felices, and Publius Licinnius Cornelius Saloninus Valerianus the most illustrious Caesar, Augusti, the .1st  of Thoth.

cu520 | 6 | Petition to the strategos of the Herakleides division of the Arsinoite nome in which the writer of the petition reports an accident involving severe injury to his brother.  Although the details are uncertain, it appears that one of the brothers, Atammon, fell from a roof in the village of Kaminou, the accident having been in some way occasioned by an attack by Libyans. The injured man has received no medical attention and his brother petitions the strategos to take some action so that Atammon's life may be spared
