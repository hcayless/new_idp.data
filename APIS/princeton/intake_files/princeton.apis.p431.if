cu520 | 7 | Letter from Sarapion in Alexandria to his brother Dorion seeking information about the searching of his house and that of another, which seems to have taken place as the result of a                                                              case in which Sarapion is involved.  He informs his brother that he is being urged to enter the household of the chief attendant at the prefect's court, which would strengthen his position                                                                  at the trial.  He notes that two officials in the retinue of the strategos are under arrest by order of the prefect until the session commences
