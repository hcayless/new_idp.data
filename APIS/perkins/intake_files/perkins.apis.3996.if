cu500_t | 1 | Dios to Zoilos, greeting. You arranged with me to come before the 25th of the month of Tybi, and have not come. When you went away, you rendered to me an account consisting of a list of what you had spent yourself. You write that you spent 33 jars upon the gardeners and two calves which you sacrificed, and you have spent upon them things of which absolutely noone has received for me the value, since you had it. Other claims are being made against you in the vineyard, of which you will have to render an account at the reckoning office. Know that, unless you pay all quickly and discharge the claims made against you, I shall seize your surety, until you pay me value of the claims. I pray for your health. (Addressed) to Zoilos from his friend Dios. Deliver to Zoilos from Dios.

cu520 | 1 | A sharply worded letter from Dios to Zoilos, who, though called the writer&apos;s friend in one of the two addresses on the verso, is blamed for his absence and for having presented an unsatisfactory account of payments in connection with a vineyard or garden-land. At the end Dios threatens to take measures against Zoilos&apos;s surety, and thoughout writes in the tone of an official superior. Not improbably he was an "epiteretes" and Zoilos a "cheiristes", the land belonging to an ousia, or being at any rate administered by the goverment. The period of the letter is probably the period from Commodus to Caracalla.
