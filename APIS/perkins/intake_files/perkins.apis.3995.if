cu520 | 1 | An application to a strategos from a woman with reference to the return of a loan, enclosing copies of (1) an authorization from the archidikastes for "metadosis" (ll. 3-8), (2) her application to him for "demosiosis" and "metadosis" of the contract (ll. 8-11, 23) and (3) the contract itself (ll. 11-22). The conclusion is missing. The terms of the loan, which was without interest, but subject to an increase of one-half if not repaid at the proper time, are somewhat unusual.
