cu520 | 1 | A woman named Senyris submits a petition to the chief judge (archidikastes), Demophon, against a man whose name is lost but who is described as the son of Pancrates and father of Senyris?s two children.  She charges the man with breaking his contract of maintenance (a kind of loose marriage contract) and running off with another woman.  The parties to the petition (both Senyris and the man) are Egyptian and the archidikastes, who would have resided at Alexandria, is Greek, illustrating the reach and importance of the Greek judiciary system among the native Egyptian population.  Not many papyri from the Ptolemaic period survive that attest the office of the archidikastes.
