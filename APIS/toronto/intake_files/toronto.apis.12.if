By all means send me the flute-player Petous with both the Phrygian and other flutes; and if any expenditure is necessary, pay it and you will be reimbursed by me.  Send me also Zenobius the effeminate dancer with the drum and cymbals and castanets, for the women want him for the sacrifice; and let him be dressed as well as possible.  Get the kid from Aristion and send it to me.  And you have arrested the slave, hand him over to Semphtheus to bring to me.  Send me also as many cheeses as you can, empty jars, vegetables of every sort, and whatever delicacies you have.  Farewell. Put them on board with the policemen who will help to bring the boat along.    Verso: To Ptolemaios
