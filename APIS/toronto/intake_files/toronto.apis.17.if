cu500_t | 1 | Hilarion to his sister Alis, many greetings, also to my lady Berous and Apollonarion.  Know that I am still in Alexandria; and do not worry if they wholly set out, I am staying in Alexandria.  I ask you and entreat you, take care of the child, and if I receive my pay soon, I will send it up to you.  Above all, if you bear a child and it is male, let it be; if it is female, cast it out.  You have told Aphrodisias, "Do not forget me."  But how can I forget you?  Thus I'm asking you not to worry.  The 29th year of Caesar, Pauni 23. (verso) Hilarion to Alis, deliver.
