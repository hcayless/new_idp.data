cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 52; Nelson collection no. N312.  Pales, son of Psenminis is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 35.  The amount paid is difficult to read, but it is written in the same manner as the amounts in OIM 19328, 19340, and O. TT 373 doc. 2368 (Vleeming 1994).  In theory it should be the same as the Greek amount in OIM 19328, 1 drachma 5 3/4 obols, but it actually appears to be 1 drachma 5 11/24 obols.  The amount appears to be the sum of the salt tax and the income of a server tax, but compare OIM 19340 where there may be a third tax.  The normal male B rate (after year 32 of Ptolemy II) for the salt tax was 1/2 silver kite (1 dr.) and the normal male C rate (after year 3 of Ptolemy III) was 1/3 silver kite (4 ob.).  Thus the income of a server tax must be 5 3/4 obols or 1 drachma 1 3/4 obols.
