cu500_pal | 1 | The fair-sized book hand suggests a cursive variety of the ma&apos;il or slanting Medinan script.  Diacritical points are used, but the text is far from being completely pointed.  Vowel signs, definitly part of the original text, are used more sparingly.  The circle with a dot is used for punctuation and collation.  A heavy red dash appears at the head of Traditions 2-4 and 7.  These may be original and may indicate a specific source.  Marginal signs and notations, which appear only on the verso (Traditions 5 and 7), are in a different hand and a darker ink and probably indicate later collation.
