cu300 | 1 | 15 papyri ; 1029.0 cm x 30.6 cm
cu500 | 1 | Undated.  Presented by Mrs. Elizabeth Milbank Anderson.  Spiegelberg first noted that P. Milbank (M) was a Ptolemaic text in a letter dated 27 June 1922 to James H. Breasted.  Spiegelberg&apos;s dating was based on P. Milbank&apos;s resemblance to T, the Turin BD published by Lepsius in 1842.  On plate LX of the latter is a demotic marginal note, clearly Ptolemaic (see Spiegelberg in ZAS LVIII [1932] 152 ff).  Georg Moeller, cited by Spiegelberg, would date T more exactly to the 2nd-1st century BC.  Naville, too, at least as early as 1904, had believed T to be &apos;&apos;of the Ptolemaic epoch&apos;&apos; (see his introduction to P. le Page Renouf, The Book of the Dead: Translation and Commentary, Paris and Leipzig, 1907, p. clii).  The name of M&apos;s beneficiary is not a certain clue, for it is of a type that begins by the 26th dynasty.  The fine lines of the writing, however, are more definite.  (Allen p. 40);There are vignettes associated with BD 1, 17, 16, 18, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 36, 38-41, 74-5, 77-88, 72, 54, 56, 59, 52, 44, 63, 45, 50, 47, 93, 43, 89, 91-2, 98, 100-2, 94, 104, 68, 71, 105-6, 108, 110, 113, 111, 114-5, 124, 119, 125, 112-3, 125-6, 129, 140, 63, 138-9, 133-4, 102, 143-50, 92, 154, 151-2, 155-62.;BD 16 consists of a vignette only between lines 133 and 134.  For discussions of similar scenes, see K. Sethe, &apos;&apos;Altaegyptische Vorstellungen vom Lauf der Sonne,&apos;&apos; in Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philos.-hist. Klasse, Sitzungsberichte, 1928, p. 259-84 and H. Schaefer, ZAS 71 (1935), 15-38.  BD 110c is a vignette only, arranged in four registers, each under its own sky.  At the top, Khepri squats enshrined on a bark behind which squat Isis and Nephthys.  In the next panel, the deceased stands praying while Harpocrates presents offerings to the enthroned Osiris flanked by standing Isis.  In each of the bottom two registers, the deceased kneels while presenting offerings to two squatting gods.  BD 110b (lines 597-600) also consists of four registers.  (597) The contents are in disorder and some of its legends are unreadable.  Deceased, kneeling with a tree behind him, presents a bundle of flax (see Gardiner&apos;s Grammar M 37 f) to the Sun-god in his bark.  A second, smaller bark bears a deity with ;an inverted basket; for a head.  (cf. a similar scene in vignette BD 17 of BM 10470 (Ani, pl. 10), where the gods are Khepri and Atum respectively.)  The hieroglyphs at left include a horizon sign, three city signs, and possibly the words &apos;&apos;his phoenixes.&apos;&apos;  (598) Deceased plows, reaps, and ;binds sheaves; before three squatting sungods.  The hieroglyphs at left repeat in part signs used in top register.  (599) Deceased threshes.  A tree precedes the bark of Osiris, above which is written &apos;&apos;His name is the Good God.&apos;&apos;  Two unnamed gods squat at left.  (600-603) The bottom register consists of two islands at right, which display respectively the words &apos;&apos;He whose name is (destined) to (be) Lord of the Gods&apos;&apos; (Or emend initial &apos;&apos;nty&apos;&apos; to &apos;&apos;aa&apos;&apos; and translate &apos;&apos;<Greater is> his name than (that of) the lord of the gods&apos;&apos;?) and the figures of three squatting deities.  Toward these deceased is poling a papyrus skiff.  The inscription at left, resembling that at right, says perhaps &apos;&apos;He whose Name is (destined) to (be) Lord{s} of the Gods, the Pig, and the 3000 Snakes.&apos;&apos;  (Or emend as before and translate &apos;&apos;<Greater is> his Name than (those of) the lords of the gods, the pig (Seth?), and the 3000 snakes&apos;&apos;?)  For lines 660-701, P. Milbank has the same sequence as T, but in reverse order, except that P. Milbank omits 25 and repeats 29 at the end (which should have been thebeginning).  For this reason, 660-701 are translated here in reverse order, since they were evidently reversed in writing.  BD 143 is a vignette only located between BD 130 and 144.  In P. Milbank, the top and bottom registers of the five registers found in P. Ryerson (OIM 9787) are omitted.  BD 150 consists of vignettes further illustrating BD 149.  M&apos;s legend &apos;&apos;Abode of water,&apos;&apos; seems to fit abode 13; the rest are not standard.  M&apos;s forms represent abodes 1, 4, 10, perhaps 11 (or is this legend meant for &apos;&apos;aat (djew qa) aa&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Abode of the two great (high mountains),&apos;&apos; appropriate to abode 4 above it?), 12 (three times), and 15, besides uncertain ones.  In the 2 columns after BD 154, vignettes of BD 151-2 and 155-60 appear, all without text.;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text.  Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.

cu500_t | 1 | P. OIM 10486, recto: (1) (BD 1) Beginning of the spells for going forth by day, the extollations of the blessed one in the god&apos;s domain.  To be said on the day of burial, of entering after going forth, by Osiris Irtywrw justified.  (2) TO BE SAID BY Osiris Irtywrw, born of Dyast justified:  &apos;&apos;HAIL TO THEE, Osiris, bull of the west,&apos;&apos; says Thoth, &apos;&apos;(thou) king of eternity yonder.  (3) I am the great god beside the god&apos;s ship.  I fought in thy behalf.  I am one of these gods of the Council who vindi(cated) Osiris against HIS ENEMIES on that day of judgment.  (4) (I belong to) thy (people), Osiris.  I am one of these gods of the Council, the children of Nut, who slay THE ENEMIES of Re {(the weary one)} and keep THE IMPIOUS away (5) from him.  (I belong to) thy (people), Horus.  I fought (in thy behalf; I interceded) in behalf of thy name.  I am Thoth, who vindicated Horus against HIS ENEMIES on that day (of) (judg (6) ment) in the great official palace that is in Heliopolis.  I am the djed-pillar, conceived in Busiris (and born in Busiris).  I was with (the Two Mourners) of Osiris (and) (the women who were lamenting) (7) over Osiris in (Washerman&apos;s) Shores.  &apos;&apos;Vindicate (Osiris) against HIS ENEMIES,&apos;&apos; (said) Re to Thoth.  &apos;&apos;Vindicate (Osiris) against HIS ENEMIES,&apos;&apos; (8) (said he,) (which is) what was done by Thoth.  I was with Horus on that day (of) (wrapping) the Dismembered One and opening the cave to refresh (the heart) of the Weary-hearted One and secreting the mysteries (9) in Rosetau.  I was with Horus in saving that left shoulder of Osiris (that was) in Letopolis, (going out) (of and into) the devouring flame (10) on that (day) of expelling the impious from Letopolis.  I was with Horus on that day of celebrating the festivals of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Unnofer justified, and of making an offering (11) to Re--the day(s) of the 6th- and 7th-day feasts in Heliopolis.  I was a priest in Busiris, (an intellectual) in Abydos, (the exalted one who was in the hill; I was a prophet in Abydos) on that day when the land rose.  I am one who has seen (12) the mysteries in Rosetau.  I was the ritual-reader of the ram, the lord of Mendes.  I was the sem-priest as his (companion).  I was the chief (master-craftsman on the day) of putting (13) the henew-bark on the sledge.  It was I who seized (the hoe) on the day of hoeing the earth in Heracleopolis.  O ye who bring blameless Souls (14) into the house of Osiris, may ye bri(ng) my soul with you (to the house of Osiris, that he may see as) ye see and hear as ye hear {and see}, that he may stand as ye stand and sit (15) as ye sit.  O (ye) who give bread and beer to blameless soul(s) in the house of Osiris, {may ye give bread and beer to blameless Souls in (16) the house of Osiris,} may ye give bread and beer day and night to (my) soul with you.  O (ye who open roads, O ye who clear paths for blameless souls in the house of Osiris), pray open ye the road(s), pray clear ye (the paths for) (my) soul with you, that he may enter in (17) anger (but) go forth in {him} peace from the house of Osiris, without his being repulsed or hindered.  {That means that} he enters praised and goes forth loved.  (He) triumphs; (18) his command is executed in (the house of Osiris.  He goes) (that he may speak) with you; Osiris (N.) goes to the west in peace.  No fault (of his) has been found by the balance; there is none who knows any.  (19) Thou (testest) me by many mouths.  (My) soul (has been) confronted with (my) heart, and it has found that I was discreet on earth.  Be(hold, I am be)fore (thee, O) lord of the gods.  I have reached (the pool of) the Two Truths, (20) appearing as a living god and shining as (the Ennead) in the sky.  I exist like one of you; (ex)alted {for me} is (my) course in Kheraha.  (21) I see august Orion; (I) tread the Deep.  There is none who can keep (me) from seeing the lord of the gods.  I smell the food of (the Ennead); (I) sit with you.  (22) The ritual(-priest in)vokes for me the coffin; I hear the offering list.  I have trodden the neshmet-bark; (my) soul has not been kept from (being) with you.  Hail to thee, presider over the west, Osiris, lord of the Abydos (23) nome.  Thou lettest me proceed in peace (to) the west.  The lords of the sacred land receive me.  (They) say to me, &apos;&apos;Praise, (praise,) in peace.&apos;&apos;  (They) make room for me be(24)side the elders in the Council.  The two nurses receive me day and night.  I ascend to the presence of Unnofer justified.  I (follow) Horus (25) (in) Rosetau and Osiris in Mendes.  I assume my forms (at will) wherever my spirit may wish (to be).  AS FOR (ONE) WHO KNOWS THIS ROLL ON EARTH (26) (OR PUTS IT) IN WRITING ON (HIS) COFFIN, HE GOES FORTH BY DAY (IN) AND (FORM) HE WISHES AND ENTERS HIS PLACE (AGAIN) UNHINDERED.  (THERE (27) ARE GIVEN) TO HIM BREAD AND BEER AND A CHUNK (OF) MEAT FROM THE ALTAR OF RE.  HE ARRIVES AT THE FIELD OF RUSH(ES), AND BARLEY AND WHEAT (ARE GIVEN) TO HIM THERE.  (SO) HE SHALL BE (THRIVING AS HE WAS) ON EARTH.  (28) (BD 2) SPELL FOR GOING FORTH BY DAY (AND) (LIVING) AFTER (DEATH).  TO BE SAID BY (N.): O sole one, who shinest as the Moon, may (Osiris N.) justified go for(th) amid (t)his thy multitude.  (29) (Savior) of those who are in the Sunshine, open {not} for him the nether world.  (Lo, Osiris N.) justified is gone forth by day (to) do whatever he may wish on earth (among the living.)  (BD 3) ANOTHER SPELL (30) LIKE IT.  TO BE SAID BY (N.): O Atum, Atum, who camest forth as the Great One from the Surging Flood, blessed one, even Ruty, would that thou wouldst speak (to) the an(cestors).  (31) Osiris Irtywrw justified, born of Dyast, has (come a)mong them.  He has issued commands (to) (the crew) of Re (at) eventide (and by) day (32) that he live after his death like Re (every day).  Indeed, as for Re&apos;s birth yesterday, he was born with every god as (was) the living one.  (Osiris N. rejoices as) (33) they rejoice when Ptah lives at (his) going forth from the great official palace (that is) in Heliopolis.  (BD 4) SPELL FOR (PASSING) ALONG THE LAND ROUTE.  TO BE SAID: I AM one who has passed (the flood), who part(34)ed (...).  (BD 5) I am the seeker of the weary one, who came from Hermopolis, who lives on baboons&apos; entrails.  (BD 6) SPELL FOR MAKING {A MAN DO THE WORK} USHABTIU DO THE WORK (35) IN THE GOD&apos;S DOMAIN.  TO BE SAID: O (ye) ushabtiu, if Osiris Irytywrw justified, born of Dyast, is counted off (36) to do any work that is wont to be done (yonder) in the god&apos;s domain--lo, an obstacle has been set up ?therein?--as a man (to) his (duties), &apos;&apos;Here am I&apos;&apos; shall ye (say).  (If) ye (are) count(ed) off (...) (37) and vice versa, (...).  (BD 7) SPELL FOR PASSING BY THE VERTEBRA OF APOPHIS.  TO BE SAID BY (N.): O (thou who art) ?only? wax, (despoiler) who seizes (by) (force) and lives on (the weary), I will not (weary) for thee.  Thy (poison) shall not enter (38) into (all my members).  (If thou weakest not,) I weaken not (for thee).  Thy feebleness shall not enter into (these members of mine).  I am the one-faced one who presides over the Deep; (my) protec(tion) is (that of) (39) all the gods.  I am one whose names are secret, whose seats are sacred, for millions (of years).  I am one who came forth from Atum; I am ?in charge of the offerings on (this) occasion?.  (BD 8) SPELL (FOR) OPENING THE WEST BY DAY.  TO BE SAID BY (N.): (40) Open (what ought to be opened).  My seal is upon Thoth, who transfigured the eye of Horus.  (Take me, O eye of Horus,) blessed one, ornament {against millions} (in the pate of Re the father) of the gods.  This is I, (even) Osiris (41) the lord of the west.  Osiris knows his whole spell.  (So) I exist yonder; I am Suty (who is) with the gods.  I shall not perish.  Stand thou, Horus, that he may count (thee) among (the gods).  (BD 15) TO BE SAID BY (N.): (42) (O) Re, lord (of rays), who rises in the {his} eastern horizon of the sky, {for yonder Re} mayest thou shine in his face when he praises (thee) in the morning and (puts thee) to rest in (43) the evening.  May his soul ascend with thee to the sky, setting out in the day bark and mooring in the night bark, and may it mingle with the unweari(able) stars before Osiris.  (44) HE SAYS (IN) (EXTOLLING) THE LORD OF ENDLESS RECURRENCE: HAIL TO THEE, Re-Harakhte, who came into being of himself.  Beautiful One, thou risest (in the horizon, illuminator) of the Two Lands with thy ray(s).  All the gods are in rejoicing (45) when they see the King (of the sky) with the lady of the uraeus (established) on thy head and the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt on thy pate.  They take their seat on (thy) brow, while Thoth is established (46) at the prow of thy bark, (punishing) ALL THY ENEMIES, and (they) who are in the nether world are come forth at thy departure to see this thy beautiful Image.  (47) I have come unto thee, I am with thee every day.  None can tread on me.  My body becomes new through (beholding) thy beauty, like (the bodies of) (48) (all) thy (favored ones), because I am one of these who were pleasing to thee on earth.  I have reached the land of endless recurrence; I have joined (the land) of changelessness.  It is thou who hast allotted (49) (it) (to me), (my) lord.  He says: Hail to thee when thou risest in thy horizon as Re who takes pleasure in truth.  Thou hast crossed the sky, with (every)one seeing thee.  (50) When thou hast gone and art hidden from their face(s), thou presentest thyself in the nether world (every day).  People prosper (when (they) row conducting) (51) thy Majesty, (for thy rays are in) their (faces).  There is nothing of electrum; none reports attaining (thy) (brightness).  (The lands of) the gods ?see thee because of? the writing(s), (as do the highlands) of P(52)unt, so that he may be examined who was hidden from their face(s).  Thou (didst) fashion (thyself) while thou wast alone, while thy form was indeed upon the Deep.  Let me go (53) (as thou goest).  (Like) thy Majesty, I shall not (cease) (for even) a little while.  Thou who coursest (afar) (leagues) by the hundred-thousands (or) millions, in a brief (instant) thou dost (traverse them) (54) and set(test).  When thou (hast compl)eted the (hour(s)) of the night likewise, {which} when thou hast overrun them and (compl)eted (them) according to thy (wont), thou illuminest (the earth) as Re when thou risest (55) in thy horizon.  HE SAYS WHEN HE (PRAISES THEE) in the morning when (thou) shinest {every day}; he says to thee (at) thy rising, when he (praises thee), (in ex)alting (56) thy form as thou dawnest and waxest in thy beauty: Thou art (the fashioner) as thou createst the body.  (O god) who bore himself, who is not born, in this horizon, thou who r(57)isest in the sky, (mayest thou grant that I reach the sky) of endless recurrence, the burial region of the Favored Ones.  (May I) unite with the (august) (Initiates) of the god&apos;s domain, (and may I) ascend with them to see (58) thy beauty at thy rising (in) the evening.  (Thou hast) (traversed) thy mother the Nether Sky; thou directest (thy face) toward the west.  (My) arms (are raised) in praise, (59) in praise, at thy setting (in the region of life), (for) (thou art) the maker of endless recurrence.  (I) praise thee at thy setting in the Deep, (I fix thee) in (my) heart, (unwearied one) who art more divine than (all the other) gods.  (60)  HE SAYS: PRAISE TO THEE, (god) who rises from the Deep and illumines the earth on the day he is born.  Thy mother bears (thee) (anew) on her hand (after thou hast illumined all the circuit of the Disk).  Thou illuminest, (O) Great One, (61) at thy rising from the Deep, (god) who created (his) family from the (primeval) waters.  Thou (make)st festive  thy (estates), guarded by thy beauty.  ?Piled high is (62) thy fare of? food offerings, greatly dreaded one, (Mightiest of the Mighty,) whose seat is remote (from sin), majestic of appearance in the night bark, great of dignity (63) in the day bark.  Mayest thou (make) him a blessed one in the god&apos;s domain.  Mayest thou grant that he attain the west, free from evil, (unconcerned with sin).  Mayest thou put (64) him among the Worthy.  May he join the Souls in the god&apos;s domain.  (May he) row in the Field of Rush(es) (after departing in) gladness.  (He) says: (65) I ascend to the sky {and to the earth}, I cross the firmament, I fraternize with the Stars.  Praise (is) offer(ed) to me in the bark of Re and (re)cit(66)ed (to me) in the day bark.  I behold the Disk within his shrine; I gladden his disk every (day).  (I) see (the bulti) in (its) (true) nature (67) at the (turquoise) spring; I see the abdjew-fish, its (fate) having come to pass.  (The EVIL-natured one) IS FALLEN, EVEN HIS ENEMY; (the knife) severs (68) his vertebra.  Re is (wafted) by a {his} fair wind; the night bark (...).  Re&apos;s (crew) is jubilant.  (As for the lady) of life, (her) heart is glad, (for) she (has) laid low (69) his enemies.  I see Horus at (the tiller), with Thoth and (Truth) before him.  All the gods are jubilant.  (70) Praising Re while providing his protection in the region of life.  To be said b(y N): (71) HAIL TO THEE, who art come as Atum and art become the creator of the gods.

If it is slow about entering, (if) his Soul (is slow about) coming to him from any place wh(ere) it may be, it shall (be) told ?by (498) the capital? to go forth to him.  Behold ye, it goes to {its} any place wherein my spirit desires (to be).  (499) (BD 91) Spell for not ?confining? the soul.  (500) TO BE SAID BY Osiris Irtywrw justified, born of Dyast:  O lofty one--may he be praised!--among his great ones, thou shalt not let (501) his soul alight among his living (relatives) on going forth (from) his corpse.  May he go on (the highway) of the west at Re&apos;s going, (502) when he has circled to the sky (from) this land.  As for one who knows this spell, (his) soul shall not alight, and the highway of the west shall be given to him.  (503) (BD 92) SPELL FOR OPENING THE TOMB.  (504) &apos;&apos;I have opened,&apos;&apos; says Ptah; &apos;&apos;I have closed,&apos;&apos; says Geb the hereditary prince of the gods, when I have appeared (505) before him.  Make way for me, (namely) for his Horus, in whom is his power, which he has subjected to him, that I may (continue to) exist.  (506) He knows through the gods that I have gone forth to look upon him (when) he rises as Re, when he rejoices (at) (507) his soul&apos;s going forth from the west.  He puts the temple of Anubis on his mountain.  I have gone forth with him.

cu590_con | 1 | When acquired, this papyrus had never been completely unrolled.  Upon being unrolled for mounting, some of the flyleaf that preceded the writing crumbled.  That end was then trimmed.  The top and bottom edges are slightly frayed and a few minor breaks occur, but even there the signs are damaged rather than completely lost.  (Allen p. 39)
