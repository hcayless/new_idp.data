cu500_pal | 1 | The papyrus was used first for a private letter.  The later hadith text was written on the back of the discarded letter with less generous spacing and in a smaller, cursive stable hand.  Errors, corrections, and spacing further mark it as a rough copy.  Diacritical points are used and the circle is used for punctuation.
