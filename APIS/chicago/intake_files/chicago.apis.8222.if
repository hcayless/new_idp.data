cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 47; Nelson collection no. N307. Psenchonsis, son of Teos is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 15.  The amount paid is difficult to read, but it is written in the same manner as the amounts in OIM 19328, 19345, and O. TT 373 doc. 2368 (Vleeming 1994).  In theory, it should be the same as the Greek amount in OIM 19328, 1 drachma 5 3/4 obols, but it actually appears to be 1 drachma 5 11/24 obols.  The amount is clearly the sum of the salt tax and the income of a server tax and possibly a third tax associated with a temple of Montu.  The normal male B rate (after fiscal year 32 of Ptolemy II) for the salt tax was 1/2 silver kite (1 dr.) and the normal male C rate (after fiscal year 3 of Ptolemy III) was 1/3 silver kite (4 ob.).  Thus the income of a server tax must be 5 3/4 obols or 1 drachma 1 3/4 obols minus any payment for the possible third tax.  The name of the scribe in line 3 is perhaps Pa-na and may be the same as the scribe of OIM 19328.
