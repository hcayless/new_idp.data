cu500 | 1 | Green and red are used, but as no surah division occurs in the text, we cannot tell whether bands were used.  A small green rosette in verso 10 marks verse 20 in the manuscript, which is verse 22 in the printed text.  (In this and O.I. A6961, the verse count is that followed in the Hijaz, Damascus, and Basrah.)  Three to four strokes mark off the verses.

cu500_pal | 1 | This Kufic script is similar to that of O.I. A6962 and A6963, but this script and that of O.I. A6961, which belongs to the same copy of the Qur&apos;an, differs only in that it is a little larger and provides more space between the letters.  Except for this and a little difference in the verse division marks, these four might easily belong to the same copy of the Qur&apos;an.
