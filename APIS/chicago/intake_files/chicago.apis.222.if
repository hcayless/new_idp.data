cu500 | 1 | Number 134 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  The meaning of &apos;&apos;katitone&apos;&apos; in line 12 is unknown.  The translation &apos;&apos;then&apos;&apos; in line 13 assumes that &apos;&apos;on&apos;&apos; stands for a meaningless &apos;&apos;oun.&apos;&apos;  &apos;&apos;Jeme,&apos;&apos; in line 13, is spelled &apos;&apos;Tjeme.&apos;&apos;  In line 15, &apos;&apos;shi&apos;&apos; is probably for &apos;&apos;ji.&apos;&apos;  The translation in line 21 is preferable to &apos;&apos;Constantine, son of Tek.&apos;&apos;  It was suggested by Crum in a letter to Stefanski.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
