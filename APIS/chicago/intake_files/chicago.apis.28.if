cu500_t | 1 | P. O.I. 13755 ( P. Qurra II) recto: (1) Praise (be)! The irrigation by the (2) Nile this year has been even with the best (3) irrigation ever. Therefore I hope that (4) this year will be, God (5) willing, a blessed year. Hence order the people of (6) your land to undertake cultivation and urge them zealously (7) and secure a contract from them to that effect. Then send out (8) for this purpose one who will carry out your order concerning it, and do not entrust (9) this to such as will hinder you from (carrying) it (out). For (10) when the land is cultivated, it prospers, (11) God causing it to bring forth its due (12) yield. Satisfy me in this, and I will not (13) blame you in the matter. For cultivation (14) by the people of the land is their chief duty, (15) after their duty to God, and (constitutes) their prosperity and (16) their welfare. (17) Peace be with those who follow the guidance. (18) Written by Basil in Muharram (19) of the year one and ninety.
