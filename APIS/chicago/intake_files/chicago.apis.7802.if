cu500_pal | 1 | Small, well-executed cursive nakshi book hand.  Diacritical points are used sparingly.  Some letters tend to be more angular than others and approximate those of the Kufic script.  Extension of letters is mostly at the ends of lines.  Carelessly executed circles, with or without a dot inside, are used for punctuation.  A dot, probably to indicate collation, is sometimes placed near or outside the circle or at the end of a line.
