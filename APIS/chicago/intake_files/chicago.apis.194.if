cu500 | 1 | Number 58 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  Michaias, son of Enoch, named in this document is probably identical with the man named in MH 2416 (number 60 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication).  Pekosh, son of Kouloje, named in this document may be the ara of Jeme named in MH 2414 (number 59), as well as Pekosh, son of Manasseh, of MH 2416 (number 60).  The mosne, in line 7, is perhaps equal to one third of an artaba or four maje.  For field reference, see Hoelscher OIP 21, pl. 32.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
