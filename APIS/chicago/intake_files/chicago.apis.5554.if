cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is rather thick and full of holes.  Each column is 16.0 cm in height.  Neither column is completely preserved, the end of one and the beginning of the other is all that remains.  The second column is written over a juncture in the papyrus, where two pieces overlap.  (Goodspeed 1898, 347-8)
