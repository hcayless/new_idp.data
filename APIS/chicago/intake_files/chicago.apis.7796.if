cu500_pal | 1 | Small cursive book hand of fair execution.  An unusual number of letters are pointed at least once.  There is little that is remarkable about the individual forms of the letters themselves, except for &apos;&apos;dal&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;dhal.&apos;&apos;  The small size of these two letters together with a marked final curve to the right tend to give them the appearance of a final ta&apos; marbutah.  The circle with a dot inside is used for punctuation.
