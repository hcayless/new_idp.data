cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 22; Nelson collection no. N277.  Senmonthis, daughter of Amenothes is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 19.  1/2 silver kite is the normal female A rate (before fiscal year 32 of Ptolemy II) for the salt tax, so this must be a semi-annual payment, which is well attested during the period of the A rate.
