(See additional OIM ostraca.)  1/2 silver [kite] 1/2 obol or 1 1/2 obols is the price of 3/4 kotule or 0.20 liter of oil.  1/2 obol is the price of 1/4 kotule or 0.07 liter of oil.  Thus, a total of 2 obols were paid for a total of 1 kotule or 0.27 liter of oil.

cu500_pal | 1 | The writing of the season name in line 3 is clearly peret because the curved third sign is the complementary r group.  The shorter writing of the season name in line 4 must therefore be shemw, which also gives a logical sequence of dates.  In line 4, the top of the sn sign appears to be ligatured to the t sign (for sn.t, "sister").
