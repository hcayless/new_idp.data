cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 7; Nelson collection no. N261.  For another receipt for tax-farming revenues, compare P. BM 10528, dated to Ptolemy I.  Psenamounis, son of Panas is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 11.  "Pharaoh Ptolemy" could refer to Ptolemy I since Ptolemy II and Ptolemy III are usually "pharaoh Ptolemy son of Ptolemy," but such distinctions were not made consistently.  A date in the reign of Ptolemy II rather than Ptolemy I is perhaps favored by the fact that Psenamounis, son of Panas is also attested in yoke tax receipt T. BM 29532 (Brunsch 1982-83) and the scribe Parates, son of Harmais is also attested in burial tax receipt O. TT 32 (Eyre, Leahy, and Leahy (eds.) 1994), both of which are probably dated to Ptolemy II.
