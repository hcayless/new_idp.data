cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 35; Nelson collection no. N294.  Psenchonsis, son of Teos is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 15.  1/6 silver (kite) or 2 obols is the price of 1 kotule or 0.27 liter of oil.  The Greek name Psemmein is probably a transcription of the Demotic name Pa-shr-mn.  The name lacks a declensional ending, which is not unusual in Theban salt tax receipts dating before c. 250 B.C. and fits with the suggestion that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian, probably the same Egyptian scribe responsible for the second Demotic text.  The Greek name does not correspond to the name given in the first Demotic text, Pa-shr-khnsw, so perhaps the scribe of the Greek text and the second Demotic text had difficulty reading the name in the first Demotic text, though it is clearly written.  Note that the scribe of the second Demotic text also appears to write a different month than the scribe of the first Demotic text.

cu500_pal | 1 | The two Demotic texts (lines 1-2 and 5-6) are clearly written by different hands, the first using a narrow well-inked brush, the second using a broader, drier brush.  The intervening Greek text (lines 3-4) is also written with a brush rather than a reed pen, suggesting that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian (see OIM 19326), probably the same Egyptian scribe who wrote the second Demotic text since both are written with a broad, dry brush.  The anonymous second hand may be that of the scribe Esminis, who signed together with the scribe Nechthmonthes(?) on the price of oil receipt O. BM 14203 of year 30, Pachons 12, and who was responsible for many other price of oil receipts from Thebes between years 30 and 38 of Ptolemy II.  (See OIM 19158, 19294, 19297, 19302, 19303, 19304, 19310, 19335, 19338, 19347, and 19383.)
