cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 31; Nelson collection no. N289.  Amenothes, son of Parates is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6.  Moving 30 naubia of earth while excavating canals and building dams apparently fulfilled the annual compulsory labor requirement for males.  (See OIM 19341 and 19342.)  The year is probably 28 rather than 8 since the earliest receipt of Amenothes, son of Parates appears to be for the fruit tax of year 9 and the latest is for the salt tax of year 34.
