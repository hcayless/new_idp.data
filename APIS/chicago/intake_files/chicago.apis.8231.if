cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 56; Nelson collection no. N317.  Amenothes, son of Parates is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6.  The fruit tax was a temple harvest tax until the reforms of year 22 of Ptolemy II. The same scribe Petenephotes may have written the burial tax receipts O. Brook. 37.1860 (Malinine, BDE 32, 1961, p. 147-148 [2]) and O. BM 5749 (Spiegelberg ZAS 53: 122 [d]), the latter name read Pa-ti-iy-m-htp by the editor, but see S.P. Vleeming, "Minima Demotica," p. 359.  The former is dated to year 15, the latter to year 13, Phamenoth 14, perhaps 3 days earlier than this one if all the dates refer to Ptolemy II, as is likely since the latter was issued to the same taxpayer Amenothes, son of Parates.
