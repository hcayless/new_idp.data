cu500_pal | 1 | The writing is the same in all 6 columns.  It is well-formed and legibile, apparently the work of a practiced scribe.  Some haste and lack of attention is apparent in the not infrequent mistakes, both corrected and uncorrected.  Paleographically and grammatically, the text shows close agreement with the Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden.
