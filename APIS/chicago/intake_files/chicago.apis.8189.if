cu500_pal | 1 | The word for oil (nhh) appears to lack a determinative, if the following signs belong to the month.  The third sign of the season name in line 2 appears to be curved, favoring reading peret over shemw.  The season name in line 3 has only three signs, which normally would favor shemw over peret, but the third sign is curved and could be the complementary r group of peret rather than the determinative.
