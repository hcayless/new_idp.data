cu300 | 1 | 10 papyri ; 924.0 cm x 39.0 cm
cu500 | 1 | Undated.  Presented by Martin A. Ryerson.  Dates follow D.B. Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text.  Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.;There are vignettes associated with BD 16-7, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 35-41, 43, 45, 47, 46, 44, 48, 53, 50, 54-5, 52, 57, 59, 56, 63, 65-6, 68, 71-87, 89, 90, 88, 91-4, 98-9, 95, 100-7, 109-10, 112-5, 119, 116-7, 124-36, 138, 137, 140, 143-62, 191.  Most, if not all, of the vignettes were evidently sketched in ahead of the text, and the latter did not always fit as the artist had planned.  (Allen p. 19);Regarding the note &apos;&apos;Finis!&apos;&apos; in BD 140, column cviii, line 37: is this the scribe&apos;s way of saying that his source was incomplete?  (Allen, p. 225, ftnt o)  In the blank space below BD 140, column cviii, a demotic note is inserted.  Dr. R.A. Parker read it as &apos;&apos;ben wesh n ;zesh her; f&apos;&apos; meaning &apos;&apos;There is no lack of ;writing on; it,&apos;&apos; i.e., nothing has been omitted here.  (Allen, p. 225, ftnt s) At the end of BD 141 (column cix), the rest of line 37 is blank; what looks like more signs after &apos;&apos;f&apos;&apos; in the photo is a small hole.  (Allen, p. 226, ftnt n)  BD 143 in column cxii consists of 5 registers which duplicate those of T,  the Turin BD published by Lepsius in 1842.  At the bottom, the deceased is praying.  The two unequal disks before the deceased in the middle bark may (as Budge says) represent sun and moon.  (Allen 230)  BD 148b (column cxl) shows deceased praying to Osiris-Sokar, who is supported by the West-Goddess and attended by the seven celestial cows and their bull, the steering oars of the four cardinal points, four sound eyes, and the four sons of Horus.
cu500 | 2 | Location: Oriental Institute
cu500 | 4 | Pub. status: Published: recto
cu500_lin | 1 | On recto: 157 columns in hieratic, 3 columns in hieroglyphics
cu500_pal | 1 | The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60.  In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions.  They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15).  Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript.  Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous.  Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas.  A note in demotic is added below BD 140.  All of the writing is in black.  The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white.  R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD.  The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red.  The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand.  He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his.  But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii).  The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person.  His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).  (Allen p. 19)

cu500_t | 1 | P. OIM 9787 (4), continued: (10)Osiris N. is Re&apos;s follower, one who takes on his character.  He has come unto thee, his Father Re; (14)he traverses Shu.  He has summoned the Coil (of the Crown of the North); he has taken the place of this Authority.  He has settled accounts with (16)this noxious one who is in Re&apos;s way.  He has become a blessed one; he has reached this Eldest One at the limits (18)of the Horizon.  (If) the Coil repulses him, (he) bears thy Soul behind thee; thy Soul becomes mighty (20)through dread of thee and respect for thee.  Osiris N. is one who issues commands to Re in the Sky.  Hail to thee, (22)great god in the east of the Sky.  Thou embarkest in the bark of Re as (does) the (24)divine falcon after he has issued commands and has smitten with (his) Staff, with his scepter.  Osiris (26)N. embarks in thy Bark; he sails in peace to the beautiful west.  Atum speaks to him: (30)&apos;&apos;Would anyone enter?  The Sun-snake is Millions (of cubits in size), extending Two Million (32)(from) Starboard to Port, so that the lake of Millions is held back.  The whole Ennead is these on every side of him, (35)divided into the section(s) I mention.  (Each) route (lies) (between) each Million{s} and its mate.  It is a route (37)of fire; they (circle) in flame around him, around him.&apos;&apos;  (cii) (BD 132)Spell for letting a man turn around to see his house in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (5)I am the Lion who has gone forth with (6)the bow.  (He) has shot, he has netted; he is the eye (9)of Horus.  (The eye of Horus has come through) this period; Osiris N. (has) reached the shore.  (14)&apos;&apos;Come in peace!&apos;&apos;  (ciii) (BD 133)Roll for initiating the blessed one into the mind of Re.  To be used on the day of the new-moon feast.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: When (3)Re dawns in his Horizon with his Ennead in his train as the god ascends from the hidden seat, (trembling) befalls (5)the eastern Horizon of the Sky at the voice of Isis.  (6)She has prepared the way for Re before the Great One (when he circles).  Pray lift thyself, (O) Re who is in his Shrine, that (8)thou mayest gulp the breeze and swallow the north wind, that thou mayest swallow the entrails and snare the day, that thou mayest breathe (10)truth and divide the Followers.  The Bark sails (to) the Nether Sky, and the Elders have been seized at thy voice.  (12)Thy countest thy bones; thou assemblest thy members.  Thou turnest thy face toward the beautiful west, thou (comest) thither new (14)every day, for thou art that image of gold ?which bears the companions? of the Disk.  The Sky is (atremble) (16)as thou circlest new every day.  The Horizon rejoices; there is joy in thy towropes.  The gods (18)who are in the Sky, when they see Osiris N. they give him praise like Re.  (He is) the Great One (20)who seeks the coil of Re and counts its needs.  This Osiris alone is sound of character in that first body of those who are in the presence of Re (every day).  (22)Osiris N. is sound on earth and in the god&apos;s domain, sound like Re every day.  (Even) if Osiris (N.) hastens, (24)he shall not weary in this land forever.  How good it is to see with the eyes, to hear with the ears, truth twice over.  Osiris N. (26)?(receives offerings) increase(d)? twice over in Heliopolis.  He is Re whose courses are concealed in the train of the deep.  He tells not what he (has) seen, he repeats not what (28)he has heard, in the house of Him Whose Face Is Hidden.  Exultation and rejoicing (are made for) Osiris N., the divine body of Re, in the bark (30)while (crossing) the deep (among) (those) who gratify the spirit of the God with his desire.  Osiris N. is a falcon large of form.  To be said over a bark 4 cubits long (32)made of papyrus ?material? and having the Council on board, with a Starry Sky made under it, purified and cleansed with natron and incense, after thou hast made an image of Re (34)on a new bowl inscribed with Nubian pigment and put into this Bark and after thou hast made an image of this blessed one whom thou lovest in this Bark.  He (shall) sail in the bark of Re, and (36)Re himself shall see him therein.  Do not use it for anyone except thine own self--even thy father, thy mother, or thy son.  Be very careful.  (38)Initiating the blessed one into the mind of Re and putting his might before the Ennead.  Then the gods shall see him as one of themselves, the dead shall see him (and fall) on their face(s), (and) (40)he shall be seen in the god&apos;s domain like the couriers of Re.  (civ) (BD 134)Praising Re on the day of the new moon, causing that (he) sail in the Bark.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Hail (3)to thee, Re in the midst of his Bark, rising as the Rising One, shining as the Shining One, imprisoning (5)Millions at his will, turning his face to the sun-folk.  (6)Khepri in the midst of his Bark, he has overthrown Apophis every day.  It is ye children of Geb (8)who overthrow the enemies of Osiris, the attackers, when they deal evilly with the bark of Re.  (10)Horus cuts off their heads toward the sky as birds, their buttock(s) toward the earth as goats and toward the water as fish.  (12)(As for every) male and every female adversary, if they attack Osiris N., whether they descend from the sky or ascend (15)from the earth, whether they come by water or journey with the stars, (17)Thoth, (son of) the stone, (who came forth) from (the twin eggshells), decapitates (them).  Be dumb and deaf before Osiris N. as before Re, this god great of terror, great of esteem.  (21)He purifies himself with your blood, he drinks of your red blood, (O) attackers who (may) attack Osiris N. (25)in the bark of his Father Re.  Osiris N. is Horus, his Mother is (28)Isis, she who nursed him is Nephthys.  (They do for him) as they d(id) for Horus to ward off the companions of Seth.  When they see his crown abiding (31)on his brow, they fall upon their face(s).  Osiris Unnofer justified triumphs against his enemies in the Sky, in the earth, and in the Council of every god and (34)every goddess.  To be said over a falcon with the white crown on his head, image(s) of Atum, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Horus, and (37)Nephthys having been sketched with Nubian pigment on a new bowl put into this Bark together with an image of this blessed one, its body of pine, anointed (40)with ointment (such as is used) for a god&apos;s limbs, consisting of heknew-oil, put behind these deities, to whom are to be offered burnt incense and roast fowl.  (43)This is praise of Re truly.  A truly excellent spell (proved) a million times.  (cv) (BD 135)Another spell, to be said when the Moon is waxing on the day of the new moon.  (1)To be said: Open thou to Osiris (2)N., open thou to me, storm cloudiness (that) clothes and preserves (6)the beautiful Horus every day.  (O) great of forms, weighty of might, who dispels (8)the cloudiness (from be)fore Osiris N., (behold), he comes unto thee, Re, sail(ing).  (N. is one) of (12)those 4 gods who are at the side(s) of the Sky.  Osiris N. arrives on duty, ?having escaped from his (16)present bond?.  As for one who knows this spell, he shall be an initiate in the god&apos;s domain, (18)he shall not die again, he shall eat beside Osiris.  As for one who knows it (20)on earth, he shall be like the God, he shall be praised by the living.  He shall not succumb to the might of the King nor to the heat of (23)Bastet.  He shall attain to a good old age.  (cvi) (BD 136)Another, to be used on the day of the 6th-day feast, the day of sailing in the bark of Re.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Behold (3)indeed the Starry Host in Heliopolis, the sun-folk in Kheraha, the offspring of 1000 gods.  (5)(O god) who has bound on (his) band and grasped his steering oar, Osiris N. (has been assigned) (8)with them to the (?rigging lofts?) and shipyards of the gods.  Osiris (N.) takes (10)therefrom the bark recurved (at its ends), that (he) may ascend therewith to the Sky.  When they sail therein with (12)Re, he (N.) sails as the (monkey) who wards off the surf that (covers) that district of Nut (14)to that stairway of Sebeg.  The heart(s) of Geb and Nut are (16)glad, (for) the Name of the new and youthful one has been repeated.  The beauty of Re exists by his magic power; (Wenty) (18)is what he is called.  Thou art the inundation, (O) Eldest One, Father of the gods, who ?tastes better than date(s)? (20)in the heart of him who cannot be attacked, (21)lord of roaring, rouser, courier of the Ennead, esteemed, become a soul, prepared (23)against the gods.  (Mayest thou) rescue Osiris N. (25)from him who does him harm, that one who has interfered with him; may his heart be valiant.  Mayest thou make Osiris N. prevail against all the gods, (27)the blessed, and the dead.  He is mighty if the lord of might is mighty.  He is the lord of Truth, (28)one who issues command(s).  His (protection) is the protection of Re in the Sky.  Mayest thou let him pass by thy bark, (29)(O) Re, in peace.  Make way for him, that thy bark may sail, (for) his protection is (30)thy protection.  It is he who keeps the crocodile away from Re every day.  He has come like Horus who keeps (31)the Horizon clear; he has announced Re at the gates of the Horizon.  The gods rejoice over him at his approach, (32)(for) (the odor of) a god (adheres to) Osiris (N.).  The noxious one shall not attack him; those who are at (33)their gates shall not assault him.  He is the Hidden of Face within the Temple, in charge of (the sanctuary).  (34)(N.) is one who brings (the god&apos;s) words to Re.  He has come; he has reported the message to its Lord.  He is (35)this stout-hearted one, weighty of might among (those who make) offerings.  To be said {by (36)a man} over an image of (this) blessed one put into this Bark, while (thou) art pure and clean (37)while censing before Re, with bread and beer, flesh and fowl.  (It is) (a means of) sailing (38)in the bark of Re.  As for a blessed one for whom this is done while he is among the living, (39)his name shall not perish forever, and he shall be a holy god.  No evil things shall befall him, and (40)he shall be a blameless, blessed one in the west.  He shall not die again.  (41)He shall eat and drink with Osiris every day; he shall be drawn with the Kings of Upper (42)and Lower Egypt.  He shall drink (water) from the ?overflow? of the Nile; he shall take (43)sexual pleasure; he shall go forth by day like Horus.  He shall live; he shall be like a god; (44)he shall be praised by the living like Re.  Watch out for thyself very, very carefully.  Do not (45)use it for anybody except thine own self.  (cvii) (BD 138)Spell for entering Abydos.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O ye gods who are in Abydos, the total Council, (7)the whole of it, come rejoicing at my approach.  I have seen (9)assigned to me my Father Osiris from whom I came forth.  I {I} am (12)that (Horus), lord of Athribis, heir of the red (lands), who has seized all (15)and is unconquerable, whose hand--variant: whose eye--prevails (17)against his enemies, who saved his Father {from being} snatched away by the flood (and saved) his Mother, who smote his enemies and drove away the plunderer (thence, who silenced the might of) the noxious one.  (I am) Ruler (24)of the multitude, Sovereign of the Two Lands, who has taken his Father&apos;s estate in his hands, (even) (27)Osiris N.  (30)(BD 137)Spell for causing the flame to ascend.

cu590_con | 1 | The manuscript now starts a little after the beginning of vignette BD 16.  Aside from the initial loss, other damage is slight.  A pointed object had been thrust into the papyrus while it was rolled.  Some seventy holes near the lower edge, gradually decreasing in size toward the end until they cease in BD 148 b, probably represent two thrusts at opposite sides of the roll.  If only one thrust were involved, the roll as we have it would have been just over 3 cm in diameter; but its 924 cm length could scarcely have been rolled into such small compass.  (P. OIM 10486 is only 1/9 as long, but formed a roll about 6.4 cm in diameter when purchased.)  But P. Ryerson could not be checked directly, for it was already mounted in ten frames.  At both beginning and end, it had also been broken across in four places each, and there are minor breaks elsewhere.  (Allen p. 16)
