cu500 | 1 | Number 79 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  One meaning of &apos;&apos;pakton&apos;&apos; in line 6 is &apos;&apos;interest,&apos;&apos; but this is not suitable here.  For as a rate of interest, a payment of more than three artabas of lentils on a loan of one tremis would be fantastic.  A broader meaning, such as &apos;&apos;compensation,&apos;&apos; is called for and receives some support from that use of pakton which is translated as Dienstentschaedigung in Preisigke.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
