cu500 | 1 | Number 136 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  The &apos;&apos;logos,&apos;&apos; in lines 2-3, although not a logos mpnoute, is related to the &apos;&apos;promise of God&apos;&apos; texts.  Whereas those texts are official promises to fugitives that they may return home without having to face prosecution, the document requested here is a passport obtainable every year, apparently for an annual business trip.  Such travel permits, known as sigillia, are often mentioned.  They were necessitated by the severe restrictions of movement imposed by the government in order to check the flight of peasants.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
