cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 38; Nelson collection no. N297.  The Greek name Amenoth, son of Pharat probably represents the name of Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6, Amenothes, son of Parates.  The Greek name lacks declensional endings, which is not unusual in Theban salt tax receipts before c. 250 B.C. and fits with the suggestion that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian.  3/4 silver kite or 1 drachma 3 obols is the normal male A rate (before fiscal year 32 of Ptolemy II) for the salt tax, so this must be a semi-annual payment, which is well attested during the period of the A rate.  The amount "1/4 silver (kite)" written by a second scribe must be an error.  For the restoration in line 6, compare O. Ash. GO 108 (Shelton 1988), which names the same official and the same scribes and is dated 11 days later than this text.  The editor reads the last scribe&apos;s name as Djed-her sa Her-pa-hert, but the element read pa-hert is in fact a repetition of the amount paid, hedj 2/3 1/12 "3/4 silver (kite)."  The same scribe may have been Witness 2 on P. Phil. dem. 18 (el-Amir 1959) and Witness 6 on P. BM 10240 (Reich 1914).  He was probably not Witness 13 on P. BM 10829 (Andrews 1990) because of the late date and different signature and certainly neither Witness 5 nor Witness 13 on P. BM 10613 (Andrews 1990) for the same reasons.

cu500_lin | 1 | On recto: 3 lines in Greek and 3 lines in Demotic
cu500_pal | 1 | The text is written in three hands.  Both the Greek (lines 1-3) and the Demotic (lines 4-6) are written with a brush rather than a reed pen.  The method of writing suggests that the scribe of the Greek text was Egyptian (see OIM 19326), probably the same Egyptian scribe who wrote most of the Demotic text.
