cu500 | 1 | See also OIM Photo 27343.  Measurements not given.  Undated.  Allen questioningly dated this papyrus to the 6th dynasty (c.2374-2191 B.C.).  (Allen, p. 31)  Gardiner preferred a First Intermediate Period date (c.2190-2061 B.C.).  (See Willems, p. 246, n. 24.)  Mathieu dates it to the end of dynasty 6 and cites other scholars&apos; datings, as well.  (See BdE 139, p. 254 and n.59-60.)  Dates follow D.B. Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).  The numbers for the entire papyrus are OIM 14059-87.  See Lesko (p. 74) for a list of spell numbers in P. Gardiner III and corresponding line numbers.  P. Gardiner II in the British Museum also contains hieratic coffin texts and may be dated to the same period as this text.

cu500_t | 1 | P. OIM 14066, recto:  (Sp.953) (247)O you tribunal which sits in front of the Great One--and vice versa--if you send your messengers for me, I will not come to you.  If I move about, (248)I will move about as Min, I will travel as Horus who is in Ut, I have opened up my path as Wepwawet.  My face is Sekhmet, (249)...is Nekhbet, my nails are the pigeon of the gods; I will not come to you, I will not return to you until I act the fighter(?) (250)...me--and vice versa; I go all over the Two Lands, I possess my river-banks, I will point a finger to Wadjet.  (Sp.954) (251)...Nekhbet, evil... (252)...there is made for me... (253)...I am in the dark, I am allotted into the hand of the Great Lady, I am Hor[us(?)...alive] and young on the night (254)when I departed and returned in the bark of Re that I might give thrones to Nehebkaw.  My utterance is made, earth is upon me, Geb is on my vertex, (255)and I will be Wadjet; I WILL SPEAK ABOUT wood for the fire, incense, myrrh, ladanum(?), hekenew-oil, shesat-oil, &apos;vulture-dirt&apos;, &apos;feather-of-the-field&apos;, all heaped together, so that [my] flesh may be anointed with it, and that the Great Lady may be pure.  (Sp.955) (256)...Wadjet who lives on...with the Mistress of Pe there; (257)[I am Sekhmet], Bastet the beloved(?)... (258)I am Wadjet when she is sick(?), she who guards the seasons(?) on the day of...[living and] (259)equipped on the vertex of the silent ones from whom I have flown up.  The gods have served me, they have seen my soul at my throat as the Mistress of All Years.  (260)[BECOMING] A VULTURE.
