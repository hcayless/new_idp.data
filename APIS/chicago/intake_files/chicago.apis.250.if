Tax money is designated as &apos;&apos;arithmia&apos;&apos; (&apos;&apos;reckoned&apos;&apos;), meaning currency reckoned at its theoretical value, in contrast to &apos;&apos;echomena,&apos;&apos; which denotes the actual value of the coins.  (See Bell p. 84-86 versus West and Johnson p. 120 and 128.)  &apos;&apos;Xenion&apos;&apos; in line 4 is a tax similar to the &apos;&apos;dapane,&apos;&apos; which is a charge for the expenses of local officials.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
