cu500 | 1 | Number 59 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  Pekosh, son of Manasseh, named in this document, may be the same Pekosh, son of Manasseh, named in MH 2416 (number 60), as well as Pekosh, son of Kouloje, of MH 2403 (number 58).  The witness John, son of Pesenthius, named here is probably the same witness as in MH 2416 (number 60).  The title &apos;&apos;ara,&apos;&apos; in line 3, is rare and its meaning is unknown.  For field reference, see Hoelscher OIP 21, pl. 32.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
