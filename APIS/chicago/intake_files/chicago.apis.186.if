cu500 | 1 | Number 50 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Measurements not available.  The phrase &apos;&apos;in holon katharon&apos;&apos; in line 2 recurs in MH 2408/2423, but in such a faulty form that one may doubt whether the writer knew its meaning.  It may be a translation of the Greek phrase &apos;&apos;katharon apo pantos,&apos;&apos; which describes the purity of wheat.  The measure &apos;&apos;shokas&apos;&apos; in line 3 does not occur elsewhere.  Lichtheim believed that Abraham, son of Atheris, was the lashane, and that Coptic ostraca contain eponymic dates after the lashane, hence her translation of nahrn as &apos;&apos;under&apos;&apos; in line 9.  For field reference, see Hoelscher OIP 21, pl. 32.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
