Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text.  Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.;There are vignettes associated with BD 16-7, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 35-41, 43, 45, 47, 46, 44, 48, 53, 50, 54-5, 52, 57, 59, 56, 63, 65-6, 68, 71-87, 89, 90, 88, 91-4, 98-9, 95, 100-7, 109-10, 112-5, 119, 116-7, 124-36, 138, 137, 140, 143-62, 191.  Most, if not all, of the vignettes were evidently sketched in ahead of the text, and the latter did not always fit as the artist had planned.  (Allen p. 19);BD 16 is a vignette only; everything that preceded it is lost.  For discussions of similar scenes, see K. Sethe, &apos;&apos;Altaegyptische Vorstellungen vom Lauf der Sonne,&apos;&apos; in Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philos.-hist. Klasse, Sitzungsberichte, 1928, p. 259-84 and H.

cu500 | 4 | Pub. status: Published: recto
cu500_lin | 1 | On recto: 157 columns in hieratic, 3 columns in hieroglyphics
cu500_pal | 1 | The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60.  In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions.  They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15).  Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript.  Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous.  Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas.  A note in demotic is added below BD 140.  All of the writing is in black.  The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white.  R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD.  The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red.  The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand.  He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his.  But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii).  The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person.  His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).

Variant: they are the great large twin uraei that are on the brow (15)of his Father Atum.  Variant: &apos;&apos;his twin plumes on his head&apos;&apos; are his eyes.

Variant: that means the twin leaves of the door (24)through which his Father Atum proceeds when he proceeds to the eastern horizon of the sky.  (O) Ancestors, give me your hands.  It is I, who came into being through you.  Whom (25)does that mean?  They are the drops of blood that dripped from the phallus of Re when he set about cutting himself.  Then they became gods, i.e., those that are before Re.  (26)They are Authority and Perception, who are in the train of their Father Atum daily.  Osiris this N. filled out (27)the Sound Eye after its crushing on that day when the Two Comrades fought.  What does that mean?

(lifted) (29)the hair ?away from? the Sound Eye at (its) time of raging.  What does that mean?  That right eye of Re when it was raging against him after (30)he sent it forth.

Hail to you, gods, lords of Truth, Council around (2)Osiris, who inspire terror in sinners, (ye) who are in the train of Hetep.s-khew.s.  Behold, I am come unto you that ye may remove all the evil that adheres to me, just as ye (did) (for) (3)those seven blessed ones who were in the retinue of their Lord the Examiner and whose seat(s) Anubis prepared on that day (called) Come Thou to Us.  What does that mean?  As for these &apos;&apos;gods, lords of truth,&apos;&apos; (4)they are Thoth and Asdez the lord of the west.

As for them &apos;&apos;who inspire terror in sinners, (them) who are in the train of Hetep.s-khew.s, they are the Crocodiles that are in the water.  As for Hetep.s-khew.s, she is the eye (6)of Re.

And as for (the head of) the Council of Naref, ?his greatness (belongs) to? (10)his Father Re.  As for &apos;&apos;that day (called) Come Thou to Us,&apos;&apos; it means that Osiris said to Re: &apos;&apos;Come, pray, that I may see thee,&apos;&apos; when Re was keeping (him) away from the west.  I am his Soul dwelling in his Twin Progeny.  Whom does that mean?  (11)It means Osiris when he entered Mendes.  He found the Soul of Re there.  Then they embraced each other there.

I am (13)that big cat that split the ashed-trees beside him in Heliopolis on that night of battle and guarding the rebels, on that day wherein the enemies of the Lord of the Universe were annihilated.  What (14)does that mean?  &apos;&apos;That big cat&apos;&apos; is Re himself.  He is called Cat because Perception said: &apos;&apos;He is such in this that he has done.&apos;&apos; Thus his [name] of Cat originated.  Variant: it means when Shu was drawing (15)wills for Geb and Osiris.  And as for &apos;&apos;him who [split] the ashed-trees besides him in Heliopolis,&apos;&apos; it means when the children of the feeble ones were (trying to) justify their action.  As for &apos;&apos;that night of (16)battle,&apos;&apos; it means when they forced their way into the east of the sky.  Then a great battle took place within the whole earth.  O Re in his egg, shining in his Disk, rising in his Horizon, float(17)ing on his metallic expanse, (thou) whose abomination is sin, rowing on the uplifted of Shu, without his equal among the gods, causing a breeze by the scorching breath of his mouth, illumining the Two Lands with (18)his sunshine, mayest thou rescue Osiris N. from that great god mysterious of form whose eyebrows are the arms of the bal(19)ance on that night of reckoning with the (female) Robber, Who, pray, is he?  He is He Who ?Carried Off His Portion?.  As for &apos;&apos;that night of reckoning with the (female) Robber,&apos;&apos; that is the night (of) fire and fallen ones.  (20)who lassos sin(ner)s (and hauls them) to (his) slaughtering-block which does away with Souls.  Who, pray, is he?  He is Shezmew; he is the mutilator of Osiris.  Variant: he is the zep-serpent; he possesses one head (21)bearing truth.  Variant: he is a falcon; he possesses two heads--one bears truth, the other, falsehood--which give fal[sehood to] him who practices it and Truth (to) him who comes bearing it.  Variant: he is Horus presiding over Letopolis.  (22)Variant: (he is) Thoth.  Variant: he is Nefertem the son of Bastet.  It is the Council that punishes the enemies of the Lord of the Universe.  Rescue ye Osiris N. (23)from these ?torturers?, the Slaughterers, sharp-fingered, cruel at beheading, from whose guarding there is no escape, who are in the train (24)of Osiris.  They shall not prevail over me, I will not fall (prey) to their kettle(s), for I know him, I know the name of that Smiter who is among them (25)in the house of Osiris, who shoots (rays) with his eye while he is unseen, who surrounds the sky for himself with the flame of his mouth.  He announces the inundation while it is (still) unseen.  Osiris N. (26)was sound of utterance on earth in the presence of Re, and he shall moor auspiciously in the presence of Osiris.  Offerings shall not be made out of me [for] those in charge of their brazier(s), for he (27)is a Follower of the Lord of the Universe in the books of Khepri.

(32)It is granted me to smell the sweetness which they who are in Kheraha and they who are in Heliopolis create for me.  Every god is afraid of me because of the greatness of (33)dread of me and the vastness of awe of me.  I have saved every god from his (de)tractor; I have shot until he escapes.  I live as I will, (for) (34)I am Uto, (lady of) the devouring (flames).  If they ascend to me, few of them (reach me).  What does that mean?

The heart of Osiris is happy, the heart of Horus is happy, while the two sanctuaries are (14)content therewith.  Verily Thoth comes and vindicates Osiris N. (16)against his enemies before the great Council of every god and every goddess (and) before the Lord of the Universe.  He does away with the enemy of Osiris N.; (18)[he] does away with all the evil that adheres to him.  If this purifying spell is uttered, it assures going forth by day [af]ter mooring (20)by a man and assuming any form at will.

Atum has assigned and the Ennead has confirmed the two regions of beauty to the vindicated one, Horus the son of Isis and son of Osiris, (9)forever and ever, (even) Osiris N.  Osiris presiding over the westerners, both sanctuaries of the gods together, and every god and (11)every goddess who is in the sky and in the earth are vindicating Horus the son of Isis and the son of Osiris against his enemies before Osiris presiding over the westerners, are vindicating Osiris N.

They have been decapitated, they have been strangled, their arm(s) have been cut off, their heart(s) have been removed.  They have been given (to the Great) Annihilator (41)in the valley; they shall never escape from the custody of Geb.  If this spell is uttered over wreaths put on a man&apos;s head, after thou hast offered (43)burnt incense to Osiris N., there is brought about his vindication against his enemies, whether he be dead or alive; and he shall be {to be said} (45)a follower of Osiris, while a cake, a jar, and a loaf are given him before this god.

This breast of mine pays (32)homage to Atum (when) he leads me to the den of Seth without (34)its being given to Osiris presiding over the westerners.

(7)Weigh not (heavy) against me before the Gods; weigh not heavy against me before the great God the lord of the west.  Hail to (10)thee, thou heart of Osiris presiding over the westerners; hail to thee, viscus.  Hail to you, ye Gods who preside over (13)the tressed one(s) and grip your scepter(s).  Tell ye the good (deeds) of Osiris (15)N.; commend ye (him) to Neheb-ka.  Though (18)I have been interred (at) the west side of the sky, may I continue on earth, (20)that I die not in the west (but) become a blessed one therein unto endless recurrence.

To be said on it as a charm: (25)My heart of my mother, my heart of my mother, my breast of my being, rise not against me as witness, oppose me not in the Council.

Make not my name to stink in the presence of the Council who create man in his time in the goodly place (32)of hearing gladness and of conducting trials.  Tell no lie against me in the presence of the great god.  Behold, thy reputation is (at stake).  (xxi) (1)(BD 64)Knowing the spells for going forth by day in a single spell.  To be said by Osiris N.: I am yesterday, and I know the dawn of (2)tomorrow, (being) in charge of its birth on another occasion.  (I am) the Hidden of Souls who made the gods, who puts the Westerners to rest in (3)the west of the Sky, steersman in the east, Two-faced One (seen by) his rays, cloud-lord who came forth from the twilight, (4)whose manifestation is in the house of the sky.  O (ye) falcons, the two Horuses who preside over their tribunal, who hear cases (5)?presented orally?, while the foreleg is bound on the neck, the rump on top of the head of the west, who guide the dead to (their) (6)tombs, who draw Re as (their) follower (in) his great seat, heart of the (divine) dwelling that is above the sky, the throne-owner, who stands as the reliance (7)of the earth, I am he, and vice versa.  I made the glaze which Ptah fused upon his metal.  (O) Re, thou laughest, thy heart (8)rejoicing over thy goodly (truth) of this day.  Enter into the Nether Sky, come forth from the east, (thou) whom the First-born summons and the Ancestors adore.  Make pleasant for me thy ways; make (9)broad for me thy paths.  When thou crossest the earth to the breadth of the sky, thy light is upon me, (O) sou(l of) three.  As I approach the god, say in my ears, (O thou) who hearest in the nether world, (10)(that) no sins of my mother&apos;s are (held) against me.  Rescue thou me, protect thou me, from him who closes his eyes in the evening, who ?veils? Atum in darkness.  I am the flood; (11)Great Black Water is my Name in the temple.  My outside envelops me inside it.  O thou Great One without a channel, summon those who are in the rushes at the hour of carrying (12)the god.  Say, pray, to him who is in charge of his (flood): &apos;&apos;Behold, the foreleg of the god is bound for him on the neck, the rump on top of the head of the west.&apos;&apos;  (I) have had him who was in (thee, O thou) greater of the two great (goddesses), (13)put into me.  I weep at seeing you.  (When) I sail from the embankment at Abydos, (O ye) bolts, come to rest at the gate face down.  Thy arms are within thee, (14)thy face is (that of) a greyhound, as thou sniffest at the shrine whence I propel my feet (as) Anubis (when) I withdraw from the resting-place of Tatenen to (that of) Ruty.  Preserve thou me, (for) (15)I am one who has gone forth as smasher of the door, (I am) the light which his heart made.  I Know the Water-Dwellers is my name.  I provide for the {his} needs of the blessed, who number 3,(16)300,000 with 1200 of everything, (for) I am in charge of their possessions, ?so that they are sup(plied at the proper)? hour(s) on the day of investigating the bearers of Orion.  (Each bearer) is (1/12)of the passing (day) (17)as a whole, (as) one of them gives (place) to another.  (One-)six(th) preside over the nether world; they are the hour(s) of overthrowing the impious ones and of {my} returning therefrom triumphant.  Now it is these that are in (18)the aperture of the nether world; it is these that are with myself as ?twin? of Shu.  I have risen as lord of life, the goodly triumphant one of this day, in whose ascent are seven steps.  (19)My protection is the magical protection of the blessed (whose) blood is cool, (whose) wound(s) are fresh, and who have joined the earth.  The two horns have been parted by my commands, the mysterious of form by my approach.  (20)(O ye) who (crawl) upon your bellies, I have come by order of the lord of terror to do homage to Osiris.  Let the eye swallow its tear(s).  I am the (offering-)bringer in the house (21)of ?him who is abundantly supplied?.  I have come from Letopolis to Heliopolis to tell the Phoenix about the nether world.  O (silent land) wherein are mysteries, creating Form(s) like Khepri, (22)cause thou that I ascend as the Disk at the ascent of the sunshine, which I set apart in the west of the sky and which illumines the blessed in the keep, that I shine as one set free (23)at the mouth of the twin caves.  I (have) pass(ed) into the sky, I have trod upon the metallic expanse.  (I,) the Great One, hold the sunshine aloft above my eyes as the light; I soar on (24)the rays of Brilliance.  My form is (that of) Re (rather than of) common folk, and I tramp on the tails of the snakes that (dwell) in this land.  O stabber (who drivest away) (25)the shadows of the blessed who are in the sacred land, mayest thou give (me) a good road through the gates of the nether world, (for) I am acting in behalf of him who is exhausted to reconstitute him (after taking his remains) from the water.  (26)I have reconstituted him who was in tears; that is, I have rescued him from the hidden ones who are yonder, the silent one(s).  (O) realm of the dead, open for me the keep.  Mayest thou give me a good road, that I may pass.  (27)(Who, pray,) is he whom he would devour in the west?  I am the presider over Rosetau.  I entered in his name; I went forth as a favored one, lord of the millions of earth, who had made his (own) name.  (28)I became weary and have put down my burdens.  The Musicians (gave me birth before) them that walk head downward.  Sealed was the door through this wall overturned by my hand.  I have revived him who had fallen (29)on his back, the phoenix whom the dwellers in their hall adore.  To Horus his eye has been given, that his face may become bright at dawn.  His name is my name; there is none higher (30)than I.  (My) form is (that of) the Lion; the equipment of Shu is with me; I am nephrite.  (How) good it is to see the mooring of the Weary-hearted One, (when he has alighted) in the ?reedy stream?.  Behold, I have ascended; I am (31)possessor of life.  I praise the deep; I am life.  I have ascended; I have offered praise at the entrance of the sacred abode.  (O) Osiris, mayest thou protect me from want; (O) Osiris, I am thy property (32)on earth.  I have embraced the sycamores, and the sycamores (have) shelter(ed me).  Opened for me is the Nether World; I have come, I have alighted on the Sound Eye.  (O) my (Soul), where, pray, art thou (on) the first day (of the lunar month) (33)while my corpse is silent, not speaking?  I have come to see him who is in his coiled uraeus (face) to face and eye to eye.  The wind rises as he ascends, and weariness ?shows? in my face.  Headdress-(34)Wearers, give me your hands, offspring who came forth from the mouth, Dawnings of the eye of Re, that I may stand.  (O) reassemblers, may I soar to the sky, may I alight on the earth, (every day).  (35)I want--variant: I embrace--my eye yonder in (attendance on) me.  I am the Creator, the child of yesterday, who fashions form(s).  (O) earth-god, deliver (me) at the (proper) time, for I am one whom the Fighter who banished the Swathed One (has) hidden away.  (36)Follow me.  (My) magic is the preserver of my flesh; my spells are the magical protection of my limbs at this time.  It depends on (37)my advice, and the Ennead relies on what I say.  (O) Lion, even Re, who liftest up him that is in Wednet, thou art I, and I am thou.  My manifestation is thy manifestation; thy form is my form.  I am (38)the Flood; Great Black Water is my name.  My manifestation is become (that of) Khepri; the herbage of Atum (attaches) to me.  I enter into Letopolis; I go forth in blessedness.  I am truly (39)Osiris, and I behold thy human form forever.  As for the silent one who knows this spell, he ascends and descends in the god&apos;s domain, he does all that the living do.  It is the great(est) protection of (40)the great God.  This spell was found in Hermopolis on a brick of the ore of Upper Egypt, written in real lapis lazuli, under the feet of this god in the time of the Majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Menka(u)re, (41)by the King&apos;s son Hardedef when he was going about to inspect the temples, ?a (military) force? being with him.  He obtained (it) by pouring out (largess) and brought it as a desideratum to (42)the King when he saw that it was a foreigner&apos;s secret, unseen and unheard.  One who recites this spell (must be) pure and spotless, without coming near any abomination of a pure man.  Lo, there shall have been made for him (43)a scarab of nephrite ?set (in)? and adorned with gold, and there shall have been performed for him the (ritual of) opening of the mouth, it (the scarab) being anointed with prime oil--variant: myrrh--and put inside his body on the day of interment.  To be said on it as a charm: (44)&apos;&apos;My heart of (my) Mother, my heart of (my) Mother, my breast (...).  (xxii) (BD 31)Spell for driving off crocodiles that come to take a man&apos;s magic away from him in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)Back!  Give way!  Back, ?bloated one?!  Come not against me, (for) I live on my magic, lest I tell (5)this (thy) name to the great god who lets thee come.  Messenger is the name of one; Baboon is the name of the other.  Thy face is (turned) to the breeze--(7)variant: Truth; the sky conjures thee in its hour.  {I} My magic conjures away his lies; I have conjured (9)my mouth with my magic which (I) have eaten.  My teeth are of flint; my teeth are of the Viper Mountain.  O seated one (11)who illumines himself with the eye which is this magic of mine, mayest thou not (let) yonder crocodile who lives on his magic take it away.  (13)I am the bull presiding over his fields.  I am truly Osiris, to whom his Father Geb and his Mother Nut were sealed (15)on that day (of) making the great slaughter.  My Father is Geb, my Mother is Nut.  I am Horus the Elder on the day (17)of festival; I am Anubis on the day of the Centipede.  I am truly Osiris.  (O) Elder God, enter and tell the collector of writings, (19)the doorkeeper of Osiris, that I am come blessed, esteemed, and powerful.  I have come, (21)(for) I have saved my own body.  I have sat on that resting-place of Osiris, for I am (re)born with him.  I am a youth, (23)(I am a youth).  I bared that thigh which was under the side of Osiris, with which I opened the mouth(s) of the gods.  (25)I have sat beside him as scribe of the sound-hearted one.  1000 of bread and 1000 of beer from the offering table of (my) Father Osiris (and 1000)of spotted cow(s), (27)of longhorn(s), of red cows, of ra-geese, and of tcherep-geese (are) what (I) give (to) Horus.  (I make) offerings (to) Thoth; I sacrifice to (29)him who is over ?Turah?, the scribe of the sound-hearted one.  I have contented myself with the offering of the ruler of (Busiris), over (31)whose shores I (wander).  I smell the east wind by its (hair); I grasp the west wind by (its) tresses.  (33)I have circled the sky past its four corners; I (grasp) the south (wind) by its eyelash.  I give breath to the worthy (35)among the eater(s) of bread.  As for one who knows this spell, he goes forth by day, he walks on earth (37)among the living, he perishes not forever.  A truly excellent spell (proved) a million times.  (xxiii) (BD 32)Spell for driving off the four crocodiles that come to take a blessed one&apos;s magic away from him in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)The Great One falls on his belly--variant: on his side.  (When) his Ennead has reconstituted him, (5)the Son comes, he speaks with his Father, he rescues this Great One from those four crocodiles.  I (7)know them by their Name(s) and their live(s).  I am one who rescues his Father from them.  Back, crocodile (9)of the west, who lives on the Tireless Stars, (for) thy abomination is in my belly.  (I have) swallow(ed) the neck of Osiris; (11)I am Seth--variant: Thoth.  Back, crocodile who is in the west, (for) there is a snake in my belly.  (13)(I) will not give myself to thee; thy flame (prevails) not against me.  Back, crocodile of the east, who lives on those that are in (15)their wrappings, (for) thy abomination is in my belly.  I have proceeded; I am Osiris.  Back, crocodile who is in the east, (17)(for) there is a snake in my belly.  (I) will not give myself to thee; thy flame (prevails) not against thee.  Back, crocodile of the south, (19)who lives on dung and choking smoke, (for) thy abomination is in my belly.  What is in thy hand is not blood; I am (21)Soped.  Back, crocodile of the south, (or) I will wipe thee (dry), (for) my navel cord is of bebet-plants.  (I) will not give myself to thee.  (23)Back, crocodile of the north, who lives on that portion ?for the time being?, (for) thy abomination is in my belly.  (25)(Thy) poison is upon me; I am Atum.  Back, crocodile who is in the north, (for) Selqet is in my belly (27)without my having begotten her.  I am the green-eyed one.  What is (28)is in my grasp; what is not is in my belly.  I am clothed and equipped with (30)my magic.  This which is above me and below, completed for me, is Re.  The width of my throat increases for me in the dwelling of (32)(my) Father the great one.  He has given me that goodly west which effaces the living.  Powerful is the Lord (34)(though) doubly wearied--variant: who makes doubly pregnant--therein every day.

Make something go downstream, (10)make something go downstream, Osiris N., (13)(and) pass thou it.  &apos;&apos;(O) zek-snake,&apos;&apos; say the sam-plants, (15)&apos;&apos;be on thy guard against the aqrew-trees, (for) these are Osiris, who asks for his burial.&apos;&apos;  The eyes (19)of the ?First-born? fall; his washerman ?(is) against? thee.  (20)He shares Truth (with) him who assigns standings.  (xxvi) (BD 36)Spell for driving off a cockroach in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (5)Keep away from me, (for) my lips are crooked.  (7)I am Khnum, lord of the Circuit, who brings the words of the gods (to) (10)Re; I report the message to its Lord.

It is to be recited to drive off the two merty-snakes.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)I am Ruty, the First-born of Re-Atum in Khemmis.  (Ye) who are in (7)your pavilion(s), be my guides; (ye) who are in your hole(s), make way for me.  Wave(s) and water serve me (11)on this route of the bark of Atum.  I stand on the ?deck? of the bark (of) Re.  (I) recite (15)his words to the common folk; I repeat his words to the narrow-throated one.  I have sought (18)my Father at eventide; I have opened my mouth that I may eat of life.  I live (21)in Busiris; I live again after death like Re every day.  (xxviii) (BD 39)Spell for driving off the refref-snake in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Back!  Stumble, (3)thou who recoilest along with Apophis.  Mayest thou swim to (4)the pool of the deep, to the place where thy Father has ordered that thou be cut to pieces.  Keep away from this birthplace (6)of Re, (thou) trembler before him.  I am Re, (thou tr)emble(r) before him.  Back!  Keen is he whom thou takest on; (8)Re has made (thy words) harmless.  Thy face has been turned upside down by the gods; (9)thy breast has been torn out by the (lynx).  Thy bonds have been commanded by (10)the scorpion; thy injury has been commanded by truth.  The wayfarers have overthrown thee.  Fall, stumble, (12)(O) Apophis, enemy of Re.  Re is gone in safety from the east of the sky at the sound of the storm (14)roaring.  The portals of the horizon have been opened before Re, that he may ascend, though he faints (from) wounds.  I do (16)thy will, I do thy will; I do good, I do good.  I do (it) when Re sets; I make rejoicing to thy bonds, (O) Re.  (18)Apophis is fallen and bound.  The southern, northern, western, and eastern gods have bound him; (20)their bond is with him.  The Earth-God (has) overthrow(n) him; He Who Is Over the Colors has bound him.  Re sets, Re sets, preserved in peace, while Apophis is fallen.  (23)O Apophis, enemy of Re, this thy sweet taste is greatly to the liking of the scorpion.  What (25)she has done against thee, so that thou art in pain because of her, persists (eternally).  May thy phallus miss its mark for thee (forever), (may) thy penis forever, (26)(O) enemy of Re.  He averts thy face, (O thou) whom Re hates, (so that) thou lookest behind thee.  (Cut off) is thy head, (O thou) whose face is cut off, (27)(who passest) along the roadsides.  Hacked off is thy head (by) those who are at (thy head; crushed are) (thy bones).  Dis(28)membered art thou by Isis; consigned art thou to the Earth-God, (O) Apophis, enemy of Re.  These are thy crew; (29)be satisfied (therewith) as one presented therewith.  He whom thou madest proceeds, proceeds to thy house, (whereas) the good (person) proceeds, proceeds (elsewhere).  No (30){no} evil harm shall go forth from thy mouth against me as what thou hast done against me.  I am the soul of Seth, who causes storm and (31)thunder when (he) goes forth from the horizon of the sky; ?like one whose heart is sad is he?.  Says Atum: (32)&apos;&apos;Lift your face(s), goodly (youths); ward off the noxious one from the Council.&apos;&apos;  Says Geb: &apos;&apos;Establish (33)your throne(s) in the middle of the bark of Khepri.  Take ye your arrows and (34)your ?shields? held for (you) before (you).&apos;&apos;  Says Hathor: &apos;&apos;Take your weapons.&apos;&apos;  (35)Says Nut: &apos;&apos;Come, ward off that noxious one who comes against him who is in (36)his Shrine, who crosses alone, the Lord of (the Universe)--(that noxious one) who hates his being kept from the (other) gods.&apos;&apos;  Say the gods: &apos;&apos;Take (37)your cakes; traverse the turquoise pool.  Come to the great one who is in (38)his shrine, (from) whom the Ennead came forth.  Utter for him spells, give him (39)praise, yea, announce him ye.&apos;&apos;  Says Nut, the Mother (of the gods): &apos;&apos;He who came forth from him, (40)he has made booty of the gods whom he received from Nut.&apos;&apos;  Geb stands guard (41)while the Ennead is pulling, pulling; Hathor, (while) the Ennead is a(42)tremble.  Re triumphs over Apophis.  Four times.  (xxix) (BD 40)Spell for repelling the swallower of the ass.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)On thy face!  Eat (m)e not, for I am pure.  Who, then, am I?  One who has come of himself.  Thou shalt not come (7)against me; I am one who has come without his being called.  Thou knowest not (that) I am master of thy mouth; (9)give way (before) thy myrrh.  &apos;&apos;O Protector of his form, which Horus has pierced,&apos;&apos; say his creatures, (12)&apos;&apos;thou hast been caused to suffer in (thy coils) and vice versa.&apos;&apos;  (Thy) Ennead is in (14)Pe and Dep, (O) child of his; go forth, (thou) whom he pierced (16)there with the eye of Horus.  (I have) repulsed thee when thou wast near; I have (done away with) (18)thee by the breath from my mouth.  O swallower of {his} sin(ner)s, O seizer by force, (21)there are no sins of mine at the hand of the Scribe of evil deeds, there are no sins (of mine on record) in the Council.  (24)(Vari)ant: (If) I am repulsed, (if) I am repulsed, then the breath shall be taken away from thy mouth.  O (26)swallower of sin(ner)s, O seizer by force at the hand of the Scribe of evil deeds, (29)there are no sins of mine.  I have caused no trouble.  I am one who has him seized at his command.  Seize not (32)Osiris N., eat him not; (for) he is lord of life and Sovereign in the horizon.  (xxx) (BD 41)[Spell for] warding off a man(&apos;s) harm in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Osiris (5)Unnofer--variant: Atum, the complete one--more blessed is he than Ruty.  (8)Opened for him are the gates ?of...?, that he may worship the mystery.  O (11)yon doorkeeper of the west, he eats, he lives on air while being led to the bark of Khepri.  (15)(I) speak to the Ennead that is in (Ishru); I go in and out.  I see, I lift (him) up; (19)I tell what the narrow-throated one spoke.  I live; I have been rescued after my death.  (23)O thou who bringest offerings, who openest his mouth, who puttest forward the writings, who spreadest out the offerings, (27)who strengthenest the right hand, he judges the Prince(s)--variant: the Elders; he enters the Council.  (xxxi) (BD 42)Spell for warding off all evil harm and warding off the mischief that is done in the god&apos;s domain--variant: in Heracleopolis.  (1)To be said by N.: The land (belongs to) the rod, the white crown to the image.  (O) standard of Osiris Unnofer justified, I am the child.  (Say) four times.  O kid of the Great One, (3)thou hast said today, twice: &apos;&apos;Prepared is the place of execution, even that which knows thy name.  Hast thou come to it as an ailing, aged one?&apos;&apos;  I am Osiris, (4)excellent of favor; I am the great god amid the tamarisks.  (How) beautiful is the skin of Re, (more so) than yesterday.  (Say) (5)four times.  I am Re, who established favor, who bound the god amid the tamarisks.  If I prosper, Re prospers, and vice versa.  (6a) My well-being is (that of) the Deep and Osiris.

Neither men nor gods nor the blessed nor any dead nor any (patricians) nor any (common folk) nor any sun folk nor ?forsaken ones? shall do (11b)any robbing of him.  He is one who has come forth sound, (for) men know not his name.  He is yesterday; (13b)his Name is He Who Sees Millions of Years Twice, who has gone along the roads of the chief examiner(s).  Osiris N. is lord of changelessness; (16b)may he be esteemed like Khepri.  He is lord of the Coil, (for) he is one who is with the Sound Eye.  (18b)(He of) the egg, to him life with you has been given, (for) he is one who is with the Sound Eye.  (19b)His place is on his throne; he sits as ?deputy? beside it.

Time after time his requirements are (26)with him, as one after another serves him, (for) he is one who is with the Sound Eye.  Nothing can happen to him; evil, uncleanness, and strife, (27)they cannot (prevail) against him.  He it is who has opened the gates of the sky, who rules the throne, who has parted the progeny this day.

cu590_con | 1 | The manuscript now starts a little after the beginning of vignette BD 16.  Aside from the initial loss, other damage is slight.  A pointed object had been thrust into the papyrus while it was rolled.  Some seventy holes near the lower edge, gradually decreasing in size toward the end until they cease in BD 148 b, probably represent two thrusts at opposite sides of the roll.  If only one thrust were involved, the roll as we have it would have been just over 3 cm in diameter; but its 924 cm length could scarcely have been rolled into such small compass.  (P. OIM 10486 is only 1/9 as long, but formed a roll about 6.4 cm in diameter when purchased.)  But P. Ryerson could not be checked directly, for it was already mounted in ten frames.  At both beginning and end, it had also been broken across in four places each, and there are minor breaks elsewhere.  (Allen p. 16)
