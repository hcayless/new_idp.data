Lichtheim took &apos;&apos;Pajment,&apos;&apos; in line 2, as a place name, but concedes that it could be a personal name.  She cannot explain the last two words of line 8.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
