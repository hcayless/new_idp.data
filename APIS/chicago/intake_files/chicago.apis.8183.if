cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 8; Nelson collection no. N262.  Amenothes, son of Parates is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6.  1/2 silver kite was the usual payment to the Overseer of the Necropolis for the burial tax on the interment of one individual in the necropolis during the reign of Ptolemy II.  If the reading of Amenrosis is correct, then this is presumably the Overseer of the Necropolis Amenrosis, son of Totoes, known from numerous burial tax receipts from Thebes between years 18 and 26 of Ptolemy II.  The identification is favored by the rarity of the name Amenrosis, even though Amenrosis, son of Totoes rarely signed receipts personally.

cu500_pal | 1 | The reading in line 3 is uncertain.  The traces certainly do not fit the expected phrase (r ta khaset); the article is clearly pa and what follows differs from the writing of khaset in line 1.  The season name in line 4 is probably shemw rather than peret since the first two signs are followed immediately by the determinative.  The end of the season name in line 3 is obscured, making it difficult to choose between peret and shemw, but peret gives a more logical sequence of dates.
