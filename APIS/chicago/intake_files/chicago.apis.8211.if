cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 36; Nelson collection no. N295.  Pales is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 35.  The Greek name has a declensional ending (noted by F.A.J. Hoogendijk), which is not unusual in Theban salt tax receipts after c. 250 B.C., and so does not contradict the suggestion that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian.  The Demotic amount paid is difficult to read; it should be the same as the Greek amount, 1 drachma 5 3/4 obols, but it appears to be 1 drachma 5 11/24 obols.  The Demotic amount is thus written in the same manner as the amounts in OIM 19340, 19345, and O. TT 373 doc. 2368 (Vleeming 1994), all receipts for the salt tax and income of a server tax, suggesting that the "remaining (taxes)" may also refer to the income of a server tax.  (See O. UCL 32219 for the same phrase; Tait 1973.)  The normal male B rate for the salt tax was 1/2 silver kite (1 dr.) and the normal male C rate was 1/3 silver kite (4 ob.).  Thus the second tax must be for 5 3/4 obols or 1 drachma 1 3/4 obols.  The name of the scribe is perhaps Pa-na; see the first scribe of OIM 19340.

cu500_pal | 1 | Both the Greek (lines 1-4) and Demotic (lines 5-6) texts are written with a brush rather than a reed pen, suggesting that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian (see OIM 19326), probably the same Egyptian scribe who wrote the Demotic text.
