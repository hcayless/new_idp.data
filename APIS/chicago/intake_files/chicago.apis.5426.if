cu300 | 1 | 10 papyri ; 924.0 cm x 39.0 cm
cu500 | 1 | Undated.  Presented by Martin A. Ryerson.  Dates follow D.B. Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text.  Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.;There are vignettes associated with BD 16-7, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 35-41, 43, 45, 47, 46, 44, 48, 53, 50, 54-5, 52, 57, 59, 56, 63, 65-6, 68, 71-87, 89, 90, 88, 91-4, 98-9, 95, 100-7, 109-10, 112-5, 119, 116-7, 124-36, 138, 137, 140, 143-62, 191.  Most, if not all, of the vignettes were evidently sketched in ahead of the text, and the latter did not always fit as the artist had planned.  (Allen p. 19);In BD 52 (xxxvi, 22-38), a few lines were omitted and then added at the end; they are inserted in the translation in their proper order.
cu500 | 2 | Location: Oriental Institute
cu500 | 4 | Pub. status: Published: recto
cu500_lin | 1 | On recto: 157 columns in hieratic, 3 columns in hieroglyphics
cu500_pal | 1 | The hieratic signs, when checked against G. Moeller, Hieratische Palaeographie III (1912), show forms varying from the 20th dynasty to about A.D. 60.  In selection and arrangement of spells, P. Ryerson is most similar to L 3079 (de Rouge, 1861-76, pls. V-XX), both having unusual additions.  They share strange writings and even errors, e.g. in BD 64 (cf. especially its S 12 f. and 15).  Hence they probably go back to a common ancestral manuscript.  Similarities with T (Lepsius, 1842) are also numerous.  Hieroglyphics occur only in BD 110b, 125d, 148b, 161S, 191-2, and the final offering formulas.  A note in demotic is added below BD 140.  All of the writing is in black.  The vignettes are colored in red, light and dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and white.  R, then, differs from Ptolemaic copies of BD.  The latter, as Daressy has mentioned, are generally written in crowded hieratic, with vignettes merely sketched in black, sometimes set off by a little red.  The scribe wrote with a consistent and steady hand.  He evidently checked his work, for the corrections are largely his.  But another, more angular hand has interlined name, etc. of deceased here and there (especially col. c) and made occasional other additions (cf. col. cxlviii).  The artist who did the vignettes was presumably a different person.  His work shows a good feeling for form, yet sometimes there is squattiness of figure (cf. overlapping scepter-bearers in col. liv) or unevenness of line (cf. kilt of deceased in cols. xxxix and xli).  (Allen p. 19)

cu500_t | 1 | P. OIM 9787 (2), continued:  (27)He is the Child (28)who has trodden the path of (yesterday); to him belongs to(day), {every} man by man.  He is protection for (29)millions.  Whether ye exist in Sky or earth, southerners, northerners, westerners, or easterners, fear of him is in (30)your bellie(s).  (He is one who fashions with his hand; he shall not die again.  His power is in your bellies,) (but) his forms are in him; he cannot be known.  (As for) the red ones, their face(s are) against him; but he rejoices, (for) (31)this (period of) time has not accomplished what it would do against him.  Where is the sky?  Where is the earth?  Children of misfortune, they cannot be united.  (32)His name ?shuns? everything evil.  Effective are the spells when this Osiris N. speaks to (you).  He it is who rises and illumines the walls one by one.  Not a day is with(34)out its appropriate activities as each (day) passes.  Behold, Osiris N. tells thee he is the blossom that came forth from the Deep, and Nut is his mother.  O thou who didst create him, (he is) one who strides not, the great commander within yesterday, the commander&apos;s portion being within (36)his hand.  There is none who knows Osiris N., (but) he knows him(self); his enemies shall not grasp him.  He is Horus presiding over millions.  Scorching breath is in (37)their face(s), so that they are roasted; their heart(s are) against Osiris N.  He has ruled his throne; he spends this time, the way (38)having been opened for him, delivered from all evil.  He is the golden ape of the gods, without hands or feet, presiding over Memphis.  If he prospers, the ape (39)presiding over Memphis prospers.  To be said: ?Mayest thou look to? thy place.  Variant: A man shall present offerings, his hand at his mouth.  (xxxii) (BD 43)Spell for not letting a man&apos;s head be cut off in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)I am Re, lord of the gods; I am the Great One, son of the Great One; (I am) fire, son of fire.  (7)My head has been given (back) to me after it was cut off.  The head of Osiris shall not be taken away from him; (9){I} my head shall not be taken away from me.  (10)(I) am put together in the right order with it, renewed and rejuvenated.  I am that Osiris, (13)lord of the west.  (14)(BD 44)Spell for not dying again in the god&apos;s domain.  (15)To be said by Osiris N.: (18)The pit has been opened, the pit has been opened, and the blessed ones fall within darkness; (but) (21)the eye of Horus shelters me, and Upwawet attends me.  Hide me among you, Imperishables, (for) (24)my heart is (that of) Re.  My face is open; (26)my heart is in its cavity.  My spell, I know (it).  I am Re, who protected (28)himself.  I am not unknown; I shall not be plundered.  (30)I am the Father, (O) son of Nut; I am thy (son), great of strength, (32)who sees thy secrets.  (I am) risen as King of the gods; (34)I shall not die again in the god&apos;s domain.  (xxxiii) (BD 45)Spell for not letting a man rot in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: Does the weary one weary (5)as (did) Osiris?  (Do the members weary as did those of Osiris?)  He--variant: it--shall not weary, he shall not rot, (7)he shall have no odor, he shall have no penis.  Treat ye Osiris (9)N. like him, (for) he is (12)Osiris.  As for one who knows this spell, (13)he shall not rot in the god&apos;s domain.  (14)(BD 46)Spell for not letting those who have been alive perish in the god&apos;s domain.  (16)To be said by Osiris N.: (19)O Youth in whose body is Shu, (gateway) powerful through its fillet of sun folk, (22)make the outstretched one stretch.  (xxxiv) (BD 47)Spell for not letting a man&apos;s seat be taken away from him in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)My seat, my throne, come, given to me, and serve (6)me.  I am your Lord, (O) gods; come to me as (8)(my) Followers.  I am the Son of your Lord; ye belong to me.  It was (10)my Father who made you for me while I was in the retinue of Hathor.  (12)I was the priest there, Ihy, while I was in the retinue (14)of Hathor.  (15)(BD 47)Spell for going forth in triumph.  (16)To be said by Osiris N.: (19)I have gone forth in triumph against my enemy.  (21)I have set the sky in turmoil; I have opened the earth.  (23)I have traversed the earth at (his) heels, (I have seized) the blessed ones, the First-born, (25)for (verily I am) one equipped as to millions of his magic spells.  (27)I eat with my mouth, I excrete with my anus, for (29)(verily) I am a god, lord of the nether world.  These (powers) were given me (31)from the (time of) breaking (the egg).  (xxxv) (BD 49)Spell for going forth against one&apos;s enemy in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O eater of his portion, get out of the way, (for) I am Re.  (6)I have gone forth from the horizon against my enemy; he cannot be rescued from (8)me.  (I) have extended my arm as lord of the Coil; I (have) stretch(ed) my legs (as) (10)the Shining One stretched (hers).  (11)I do not make that enemy of mine fall by my hand, (but) he is given to me and can(not) be rescued from me.  (14)I have stood as Horus, I have sat as the Sky.  My strength (16)is (that of) a god, my power is (that of) Nefertem.  I walk with (18)my feet, I speak with my mouth, I seek (the enemy) thereby; (and) he is given to me (20)and cannot be rescued from me.  (21)(BD 50)Spell for not entering the place of execution.  (22)To be said by Osiris N.: (25)(The knot) has been tied for me around me in the sky (27)that touches the earth (by Re), ?put (in place)? on the day (of) making the knot fast to (29)him who is weary on (his) legs, that day of ?doing away with grief?.  (32)The knot has been tied around me by Seth while the Ennead was in (34)its (pristine) power, before strife (arose).  Ye keep (me) safe from him who slew my Father.  It is I (36)who have taken the Two Lands.  The knot has been tied by Nut, who saw (its) first instance, who saw Truth before the gods were fashioned in divine images.  (38)I am [?He Who Is?]; I (am) the heir of the great gods.  (xxxvi) (BD 51)[Spell] for [...] in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)(My) abomination, (my) abomination it is; I will not eat it.  (5)Dung is my abomination; I will not eat it.  Your ordure, none can harm me (8)therewith.  I will not touch it with my hands; I will not step on it (10)with the soles of my feet.  (11)(BD 52)Spell for not eating dung in the god&apos;s domain.  (13)To be said by Osiris N.: (15)My abomination is my abomination; I will not eat it.  (17)Dung is my abomination; I will not eat it, even though ordure be fallen into my belly.  (20)I will not touch it with my hands; I will not step on it with the soles of (22)my feet.  &apos;&apos;What, then, dost thou live on,&apos;&apos; (33)say (34)they (the gods), &apos;&apos;thou (new)comer, (in) this (place whither) thou (hast been) brought?&apos;&apos;  &apos;&apos;I live (on) these seven loaves (36)of her who has brought her loaves unto Horus, (her) loaves unto Thoth.&apos;&apos;  (38)&apos;&apos;Where (art) thou (permitted) to eat?&apos;&apos; say the gods to me.  (23)&apos;&apos;I have eaten under this sycamore of Hathor my Mistress.  I have given (25)the leavings thereof to the wayfarer.  Fields have been assigned to me in Busiris (27)and thriven for me in Heliopolis.  I have lived on bread of white wheat and beer of (29)red wheat.  (Given) to me is my family, consisting of my Father and my mother.&apos;&apos;  (O) doorkeeper of the house of (31)speech, pure one, open to me, (open wide) to me, make way for me, that (33)I may sit wherever I will.  (xxxvii) (BD 53)[Spell for not ea]ting dung nor drinking urine in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)I am the sharp-horned bull who rules the Sky, lord of ?the feasts? of (7)the Sky, the great illuminator who goes forth as scorching flame, who ?values? (9)long (life), the Lion (to whom) the Sunshine&apos;s course is given.  (11)Dung is (my) abomination; I will not drink urine.  I will not walk upside down.  (14)I am possessor of bread in Heliopolis.  My bread is in the Sky with Re; my bread is on earth (17)with Geb.  (It is) the Night Bark that brings (it) to me from the house of the great god in Heliopolis.  (I) ?festoon? (my) intestines (20)at joining the ferryboat; I cross to the east of the Sky.  I eat (23)of what they eat (of); I live on what they live (on).  (25)I have eaten bread in the chamber of the possessor of offerings.  (xxxviii) (BD 54)Spell for giving breath (to) a man in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Atum, give me the sweet breath of thy nostrils.  (7)I am that egg of the Great Honker.  (9)I guarded that great egg that separated (11)Geb from the earth.  If I live, it lives, and vice versa; if (13)I grow old, (it grows old).  If I breathe air, (it breathes air).  (I am) (14)one whose purity is recognized, whose Name is about his egg, for whom time becomes pregnant, (17)the great of strength, Seth.  (18)O thou whose corpse is in Pe, and (ye) Two Lands (which) are the food and lapis lazuli of Re, (21)be on your guard (against) him who is in his nest, the {his} child, (23)when he goes forth against you.  (xxxix) (BD 56)Spell for breathing air in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Atum, mayest thou give me the sweet breath of thy nostrils.  I am (7)the First-born, the eldest, dwelling in Hermopolis.  (9)I guarded that egg of the Great Honker.  If I flourish, (12)it flourishes, and vice versa; if I live, it lives, and vice versa.  (14)If I breathe air, it breathes air.  (16)My Soul (belongs) to thee, my Lord Atum.  It circles about; it is holy.  (18)This (soul) falls (protectively) over the name of Osiris N., possessor (22)of worthiness before Re and before Osiris the presider over (24)the west.  (xl) (BD 57)Spell for breathing air and having water available in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O Inundation, great one of the sky, in thy Name of Breaker-up of the Sky, mayest thou let Osiris (7)N. have water available like (10)Sekhmet who snatched away (Osiris) on that night of the (great) storm.  (12) Behold, Osiris N. escorts (15)the Elder(s) presiding over the seat of the flood, (just) as (17)that august God whose Name they know not escorts them; and they escort Osiris (19)N.  (21)Osiris (N.) (has his mouth), and his nose is open (23)in Busiris.  He rests in Heliopolis, his house which (25)Seshat builds for him and whose wall Khnum erects for him.  If (27)north winds come, he sits in the south; if (29)south winds come, he sits in the north; if (31)west winds come, he sits in the east; (32)if east winds come, he sits in the west.  (34)His eyebrows are drawn (together) above his nostrils.  Osiris N., (38)he has access to the place where he wishes to sit.  (xli) (BD 59)Spell for breathing air in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O thou sycamore of Nut, mayest thou give me water and (6)the breath that is in thee.  It is I who occupy that seat in the midst of (8)Hermopolis.  I watched over that egg of the (10)Great Honker.  If it flourishes, I flourish, and vice versa; if I live, it lives, (12)and vice versa.  If it breathes air, (13)I breathe air.  (14)(BD 60)Another spell.  To be said by Osiris (15) N.: Opened for me {opened (18)for me} are the double doors of the Sky, parted for me are the double doors of earth and firmament, by (20)Thoth and by (Horus&apos; son) Hapi, that is, (Hapi) of the Sky, great in his time.  (22)May ye let me have water available as when Seth snatched away (24)his enemies on that day when (the Two Lands) raged.

O (ye) falcons, the two Horuses who preside over their tribunal, who hear cases (5)?presented orally?, while the foreleg is bound on the neck, the rump on top of the head of the west, who guide the dead to (their) (6)tombs, who draw Re as (their) follower (in) his great seat, heart of the (divine) dwelling that is above the sky, the throne-owner, who stands as the reliance (7)of the earth, I am he, and vice versa.  I made the glaze which Ptah fused upon his metal.  (O) Re, thou laughest, thy heart (8)rejoicing over thy goodly (truth) of this day.  Enter into the Nether Sky, come forth from the east, (thou) whom the First-born summons and the Ancestors adore.  Make pleasant for me thy ways; make (9)broad for me thy paths.  When thou crossest the earth to the breadth of the sky, thy light is upon me, (O) sou(l of) three.  As I approach the god, say in my ears, (O thou) who hearest in the nether world, (10)(that) no sins of my mother&apos;s are (held) against me.

Thy arms are within thee, (14)thy face is (that of) a greyhound, as thou sniffest at the shrine whence I propel my feet (as) Anubis (when) I withdraw from the resting-place of Tatenen to (that of) Ruty.  Preserve thou me, (for) (15)I am one who has gone forth as smasher of the door, (I am) the light which his heart made.  I Know the Water-Dwellers is my name.

(One-)six(th) preside over the nether world; they are the hour(s) of overthrowing the impious ones and of {my} returning therefrom triumphant.  Now it is these that are in (18)the aperture of the nether world; it is these that are with myself as ?twin? of Shu.  I have risen as lord of life, the goodly triumphant one of this day, in whose ascent are seven steps.  (19)My protection is the magical protection of the blessed (whose) blood is cool, (whose) wound(s) are fresh, and who have joined the earth.  The two horns have been parted by my commands, the mysterious of form by my approach.  (20)(O ye) who (crawl) upon your bellies, I have come by order of the lord of terror to do homage to Osiris.  Let the eye swallow its tear(s).  I am the (offering-)bringer in the house (21)of ?him who is abundantly supplied?.  I have come from Letopolis to Heliopolis to tell the Phoenix about the nether world.  O (silent land) wherein are mysteries, creating Form(s) like Khepri, (22)cause thou that I ascend as the Disk at the ascent of the sunshine, which I set apart in the west of the sky and which illumines the blessed in the keep, that I shine as one set free (23)at the mouth of the twin caves.  I (have) pass(ed) into the sky, I have trod upon the metallic expanse.  (I), the Great One, hold the sunshine aloft above my eyes as the light; I soar on (24)the rays of Brilliance.  My form is (that of) Re (rather than of) common folk, and I tramp on the tails of the snakes that (dwell) in this land.  O stabber (who drivest away) (25)the shadows of the blessed who are in the sacred land, mayest thou give (me) a good road through the gates of the nether world, (for) I am acting in behalf of him who is exhausted to reconstitute him (after taking his remains) from the water.  (26)I have reconstituted him who was in tears; that is, I have resurrected him from the hidden ones who are yonder, the silent one(s).  (O) realm of the dead, open for me the keep.  Mayest thou give me a good road, that I may pass.  (27)(Who, pray,) is he whom he would devour in the west?  I am the presider over Rosetau.  I entered in his name; I went forth as a favored one, lord of the millions of earth, who had made his (own) name.  (28)I became weary and have put down my burdens.  The Musicians (gave me birth before) them that walk head downward.  Sealed was the door through this wall overturned by my hand.  I have revived him who had fallen (29)on his back, the phoenix whom the dwellers in their hall adore.  To Horus his eye has been given, that his face may become bright at dawn.  His name is my name; there is none higher (30)than I.  (My) form is (that of) Lion; the equipment of Shu is with me; I am nephrite.  (How) good it is to see the mooring of the Weary-hearted One, (when he has alighted) in the ?reedy stream?.  Behold, I have ascended; I am (31)possessor of life.  I praise the deep; I am life.  I have ascended; I have offered praise at the entrance of the sacred abode.  (O) Osiris, mayest thou protect me from want; (O) Osiris, I am thy property (32)on earth.  I have embraced the sycamores, and the sycamores (have) shelter(ed me).  Opened for me is the Nether World; I have come, I have alighted on the Sound Eye.  (O) my (Soul), where, pray, art thou (on) the first day (of the lunar month) (33)while my corpse is silent, not speaking?  I have come to see him who is in his coiled uraeus (face) to face and eye to eye.  The wind rises as he ascends, and weariness ?shows? in my face.  Headdress-(34)Wearers, give me your hands, offspring who came forth from the mouth, Dawnings of the eye of Re, that I may stand.  (O) reassemblers, may I soar to the sky, may I alight on the earth, (every day).  (35)I want--variant: I embrace--my eye yonder in (attendance on) me.  I am the Creator, the child of yesterday, who fashions form(s).  (O) earth-god, deliver (me) at the (proper) time, for I am one whom the Fighter who banished the Swathed One (has) hidden away.  (36)Follow me.  (My) magic is the preserver of my flesh; my spells are the magical protection of my limbs at this time.  It depends on (37)my advice, and the Ennead relies on what I say.  (O) Lion, even Re, who liftest up him that is in Wednet, thou art I, and I am thou.  My manifestation is thy manifestation; thy form is my form.  I am (38)the Flood; Great Black Water is my name.  My manifestation is become (that of) Khepri; the herbage of Atum (attaches) to me.  I enter into Letopolis; I go forth in blessedness.  I am truly (39)Osiris, and I behold thy human form forever.  As for the silent one who knows this spell, he ascends and descends in the god&apos;s domain, he does all that the living do.  It is the great(est) protection of (40)the great God.  This spell was found in Hermopolis on a brick of the ore of Upper Egypt, written in real lapis lazuli, under the feet of this god in the time of the Majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Menka(u)re, (41)by the King&apos;s son Hardedef when he was going about to inspect the temples, ?a (military) force? being with him.

May I abide on my standard{s} (9)like the lord of the sky--variant: the lord of life.  I have united with (the divine) Isis; (she) preserves me from him who would do me harm.  May (he) not come to see his weary one.  (10)I go and come to the ends of the Sky.  I ask of Geb, I request food of the Lord of the Universe.  May the gods of the Nether World be afraid of me, may their gate(s) combat (11)them in my behalf, when (they) see thy catches (of fowl and fish).  I am one of those blessed ones who are with the Blessed, whom Atum created, whom he made, who became (12)the blossoms of his eye, whom he brought into being, whom he blessed, whose face(s) he uplifted (that they might be) with him, while he was alone.  They announce him when he ascends from the Horizon; they implant fear (13)(of him in) the gods and the blessed who have become his attendants.  (I am) one of the tadpole(s) which the eye of the sole lord create(d) (before) Isis gave birth to Horus.  Osiris is restored; he regains his youth.  (14)His eminence is (greater than) (that of) those  among the Blessed who have become his attendants.  Osiris is risen as a divine falcon.  Horus presents him (with) his (Soul) to take his possessions (to) Osiris (15)in the Nether World.  Ruty has said: &apos;&apos;(O) Osiris who is over the {his} house of the turban, (who was) in his pit, how dost thou escape to the limits of the Sky, though thou be enwrapped (16)in thy falcon form?  There is no (turban) on thee to (enable) thee to speak indeed to the limits of the Sky.&apos;&apos;  (I am) he who is to take the possessions of Horus to Osiris in the Nether World.  (17)Horus has repeated (to me) what his Father Osiris (told him) as magical protection of Re.  &apos;&apos;I give a turban,&apos;&apos; (says) Ruty, &apos;&apos;that thou mayest go and come on the roads of the Sky, that they who are in the realm (18)of the Horizon may see thee.  May the gods (of) the Nether World be afraid of thee; may their gate(s) combat them in (thy) behalf.&apos;&apos;  Be (favorably) inclined unto me, (for otherwise) there will be violence at the words of the gods, the lords of (19)the universe, (who are attached to) the shrine of the sole and only lord.  (Says) he who is high on his float{s}: &apos;&apos;Take him a turban&apos;&apos;; (so) (says) (20)Ruty concerning me.  O (favorably) inclined one, make way for me, for I know about the float.  Ruty (has) brought me the turban and (given) me (my) wings.  (21)(I) have firmly fixed my heart in (its) back, my (mouth) in its long neck{s}.  I shall not fall on Shu&apos;s slaughtering-block.  I am that goodly departed one, lord of the esteemed uraei; verily (22)I am one who knows the roads of the Deep.  There is breath in my belly; the raging bulls have been repulsed.  I go (to) the place where the sleeper is, the boatless one who presides over the fields (23)of endless recurrence, he who is my guide (to) the grievous darkness of the Westerners, (even) Osiris.  I have come today from the house of Ruty; I have gone forth therefrom to the house of the divine Isis.  I have seen (24)the mysterious sanctities, having been led to the hidden sanctities just as (she) lets me see the birth of the great god.  Horus has presented me with his Soul; I have seen what is therein.  (25)If I have said ?(so) in the presence of the great ones? of Shu, they ward off ?opposition?.  (I am) he who is to take the possessions of Horus to Osiris in the Nether World.  Verily I am Horus who is with the blessed.  (26)I control my window, I control my receiving.  I go and come to the ends of the Sky.  Horus is on his Father&apos;s seat, Horus is on his throne.  (27)My face is (that of) a divine falcon, my posterior is (that of) a divine falcon.  I am one whom his Lord equips.  I go forth to the Nether World, I see Osiris.  (If) I robe myself (be(28)fore) him, Nut will robe herself for me when (she) sees me.  The gods have seen me as the very eye of Horus with No Eyes in His Forehead against those who would reach out their hands against me.  When I arise, I drive away (29)wretchedness.  They (open) for me the impassable roads when they see my form and hear what I say.  On your face(s), gods of the Nether World, repulsive of face, who approach (30)the powerful ones and pull the Unweariable Stars and traverse (the impassable roads and the ?salt region?), because of the Lord, the Soul great of Dignity.  Lift your face(s); I have espied you.  (31)I am risen as a divine falcon.  Horus has presented (me) with his Soul to take his possessions to Osiris in the Nether World.  The Gray-haired Ones have rescued me; (32)those who are attached to their place of execution move on for me.  (Ye) who are before me, make way for me.  (Then) I proceed and reach those who preside over their pit(s), who are attached to the house of Osiris.  I (introduce) to them (33)the powerful one {like}.  I inform them like him the terror of whom is great, whose horns Horus sharpens against Seth; (I) inform them that he has taken over Authority and has provided (34)Atum&apos;s symbol(s) of power.  &apos;&apos;Pass, (goodly one),&apos;&apos; say they, the gods of the Nether World, to me; and those who preside over their pit(s), who are attached to the house of Osiris, ?rise (respectfully)?.  Behold, (35)(I have) come unto you.  Take for me, unite for me, symbols of might, the Defiers of (the lower sky--(variant:) the defiant ones of the lower sky).  Clear for me, symbols of might, the impassable (roads); guard the roads of the Horizon and its (?salt region?) in (36)the Sky.  Set up their gate(s) in behalf of Osiris; clear the roads for me in his behalf.  Granted me are my commands.  I go forth to Busiris, I see Osiris.  I tell him about (37)this his Eldest Son (whom he) loved, who hacked out the heart of Seth.  I have seen the Lord (of Weariness); so (I (can)) inform them of the plans of the gods, (plans) which Horus carried out in the absence (38)of his Father Osiris.  O Soul Great of Dignity, behold, I am come; thou hast seen me exalted.  I penetrate the nether world; opened (39)for me are the roads of the sky and earth.  None (dares) approach me (as) I exalt thy seat, (O) Osiris.  Thou hearest good, (O) Osiris; thy strength endures, (O) Osiris.  I attach to thee thy head, (I) make fast (to thee) (40)thy neck, (O) Osiris.  Thy heart rejoices, since (thy wish) abides.  Thy courtiers share thy gladness of heart, since thou abidest as bull of the west, thy Son Horus having appeared on thy throne, all life being with him.  Millions work for him, Millions are afraid of him.  The Ennead works for him, (the Ennead) is afraid (41)of him.  Atum, {his} great Power of the Ennead, who changes not, has told what Authority (said) to him: &apos;&apos;Horus is (clever), expanding shrunken faces for his Father.  Horus is the rescuer of his Father, Horus is the rescuer of his Mother.  (42)Horus is (my) Brother, Horus is my friend.  Horus came from the seed of his Father while his body was in (process of) decomposition.  He rules Busiris, and the gods work for him.  He has rescued Millions, he (gives new) life to Millions, by means of his eye, sole one of her Lord, Lady of the Universe.  (lvi) (BD 79)Spell for becoming the Greatest in the{ir} Council.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: I am Atum, (4)who made the Sky, who created what exists, who came forth from the earth, (5)who brought seed into being, lord of what is, who begot the gods, great god who came into being of himself, lord of life, (7)who causes the Ennead to prosper.  Hail to you, Lords of Possessions, pure ones, Hidden (9)of Seat.  Hail to you, lords of eternity, concealed of form, secret (11)of sanctuary, whose place where they are is not known.  Hail to you, gods (13)who circle the Firmament in the west, namely the Ennead within (15)the Nether Sky.  Behold, (I) am come unto you, I being pure, divine, (17)blessed, powerful, (possessed of a soul,) and mighty.  I (have) brought you bed- and (19)hezmen-natron, that I may do away with the saliva from your mouth(s).  I have come; (21)I have done away with the evil that was in your heart(s); I have detached the sins (23)that adhered to you.  I (have) brought to you goodness; (24)I cause truth to ascend to you.  I know (you, I know) your Name(s), (26)(I) know your forms, which (those) who came into being through you do not know.  (I have come unto you,) appearing (28)as that god (among men) at sight of whom the gods live.  I become powerful in your presence (30)as that god, high on his Standard, to whom the gods come (32)with rejoicing and whom the goddesses acclaim when they see him.  (34)I (have) come unto you, appearing in your place.  I sit on my seat that is in (36)the Horizon; Horizon come to me with rejoicing, praise is given (to me) (by) those who are in the Nether World, in this (my) dignity (of) lord of all (42)mankind, I (being) exalted (as) that august god, lord of the Great House, whom the gods rejoice at seeing his beau[tiful] egress [from] the belly (44)of the Nether Sky when his Mother Nut has borne (him).

I fell with him in the valley of Abydos (12)when I went to rest.  I am one who remembers; I seized Authority in the city (14)wherein I found (him), (and) (I) conquer(ed) the darkness by his power.  (16)I am the woman who illumines the darkness.  (I have come that I may illumine the darkness; yea,) (it) shall become light.  (17)I rescued the eye of Horus when it was nothing (before) the fifteenth day had come.  (19)(I) join(ed) Seth in the upper chamber(s) in addition to the aged one (who was) with him.  (21)I equipped Thoth in the house of the Moon (after) I had taken the Upper Egyptian crown.  His truth is (23)in my belly, (with) turquoise and fayence at its monthly feast(s).  His fields (25)yonder are (of) lapis lazuli at his feast.  (26)(I have) take(n) the darkness; I have overthrown the ignorant.  (28)Those who were in darkness praise (me); the Mourners, whose face(s) were hidden, rise for me, weary though they be.  (31)(Just) see ye me; (I am) the Deep.  (I) will not let you hear (33)about it.  (34)(BD 81)Spell for assuming the form of a lotus.

(My) abomination is (my) abomination; (8)I will not eat it.  Dung is my abomination; (10)I will not eat it.  The abomination of my Spirit shall not enter into (12)my belly.  &apos;&apos;What dost thou live on?&apos;&apos; say they, say the gods and the blessed.  (14)I live (and thrive) on the bread ?of him who befriends (me) on? the road.  (Say) twice.  &apos;&apos;Whereof dost thou eat?&apos;&apos; (say they,) (16)the gods and the blessed.

If thou art slow about bringing my Soul to me from (8){from} any place where it may be, thou shalt find the eye of Horus (18)standing against thee like those.  O gods who tow the Bark (20)of the Lord of Millions, who bring the sky to the nether world, who do away with (the secrets) of the Lower Sky, (22)who cause Soul(s) to approach mummies, whose hands are full with the towropes, (24)ye shall grasp your spear(s) and drive away the enemy, and the Bark shall rejoice (26)and the great god (proceed) in peace.  (27)Lo, may ye put this Soul (of mine) under your buttocks in the eastern Horizon of the Sky to (29)follow to the {its every} place where it was yesterday in peace, in peace, unto the west.  (31)(Then) shall it see its corpse and come to rest on its mummy.  {It shall not pass away.}  (33)It shall not perish, it shall not pass away, (for)ever and ever.

(O) eye of Horus, take thou (7)Osiris Unnofer justified; fix thou (his) beauty in the pate of Re.  (O) far-(9)strider, long-stepper, make way for me, (great one), (my) flesh being firm.  (11)I am Horus who saved his Father and brought the crown of Upper Egypt before him.  (13)Open a way for my Soul, (for) I control my feet.  (Then) shall I see the great god within (15)the Bark of Re on the day of counting Souls, my Soul being there in front among (17)the counter(s) of years.  Come to me, take for me my Soul, (O) eye of Horus.  Fix (19)its adornments in the pate of Re while the twilight is before them.  (O ye) who are in the members (21)of Osiris, (ye) shall not confine my Soul, ye shall not restrain my shadow.  Open (23)a way for my Soul, for my shadow, for (my) blessed one, that I may see the great god within (25)his shrine on that day of counting Souls and repeat my words to Osiris.  (O ye) who(se seats) are hidden, (27)(attendants of) the members (of Osiris), ye restrain Souls and blessed ones and seal (29)off the dead.  (But they) who would do evil against me, they shall not do evil against me.  (31)Go (far to) thy Spirit and my Soul.  (O) my equipped blessed one, {to} (33)may they lead thee; mayest thou sit {me} before the elders of the highest rank.  (35)I shall not be confined by (the attendants of) the members of Osiris, who restrain {the members of} Souls and lock up (37)shadows and the dead.  &apos;&apos;Wouldst thou seize me?&apos;&apos; says the Sky.

(lxviii) (BD 93)Spell for not letting a man be ferried to the east in the god&apos;s domain.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (3)O thou phallus of Re, this deserts {deserts} him, and (6)he suffers diminution by storms.  The affairs of the weary by millions become (those of) Bibi; (but) I grow more powerful thereby than the powerful, I grow mightier thereby than the mighty.  (10)As for one who may ferry me, as for one who may take me, to the east, if (12)anything evil is done against me at the feast of transgressors (by) twisting the horns (14)of Khepri, then that phallus of Re shall swallow (16)the head (of) Osiris when I am come, led to the fields (18)of him whom the gods beheaded, that they may feed therein on (me).  (20)Then the horns of Khepri shall {not} gore, and pellets shall {not} develop in (22)the eye of Atum the annihilator, because of him who deceives me and ferries me to (24)the east, because he makes the feast of transgressors off of me, because evil harm is done me.  Alternative: (27)If nothing evil is done against me at the feast of transgressors by (29)twisting the horns of Khepri, then that phallus (31)of Re shall not swallow the head of Osiris when I am come to the fields (33)of him whom the gods beheaded, that they may feed on me.  Then the horns of Khepri shall not (gore), and (36)pellets shall not develop in the eye of Atum, and he shall not annihilate.  None shall snatch me away, none shall ferry me to (39)the east to make the feast of transgressors off of me {evil}.  None shall do evil harm to me, (42)none shall ferry me to the east.  (lxix) (BD 94)Spell for obtaining the palette and water-bowl from Thoth.  (1)To be said by Osiris N.: (4)O great one who sees his Father, attendant of the book of Thoth, (6)behold, I am come blessed, possessed of a soul, mighty, (8)equipped with the writings of Thoth.  Hasten, Earth-God (10)who art ?in? Seth; bring me the palette, bring me the water-bowl and (12)that writing case.  It is your secret that is in them, (O) gods.

cu590_con | 1 | The manuscript now starts a little after the beginning of vignette BD 16.  Aside from the initial loss, other damage is slight.  A pointed object had been thrust into the papyrus while it was rolled.  Some seventy holes near the lower edge, gradually decreasing in size toward the end until they cease in BD 148 b, probably represent two thrusts at opposite sides of the roll.  If only one thrust were involved, the roll as we have it would have been just over 3 cm in diameter; but its 924 cm length could scarcely have been rolled into such small compass.  (P. OIM 10486 is only 1/9 as long, but formed a roll about 6.4 cm in diameter when purchased.)  But P. Ryerson could not be checked directly, for it was already mounted in ten frames.  At both beginning and end, it had also been broken across in four places each, and there are minor breaks elsewhere.  (Allen p. 16)
