cu500 | 1 | Number 232 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  The Coptic word "demosion" (from the Greek "demosia") can refer to taxes in general or to the land tax specifically.  In these texts, the former meaning is indicated by a plural definite article ("ndemosion"), while in the latter case, it is indicated by the singular definite article.  Additionally, when used to mean taxes in general, the word appears in the phrase "in the demosion of indiction X," while when referring to the land tax, it is used in the phrase "for your demosion in katabole X of year X."  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
