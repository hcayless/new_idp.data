cu500 | 1 | The line spacing in this manuscript is identical to Arabic Palaeography (1905) by B. Moritz pl. 45 b.  Given the estimation that this page was approx. 14-15 x 9 cm in its original form and the fact that the scripts are similar in every detail, this manuscript and Ar. Pal. pl. 45 b evidently belong to the same copy of the Qur&apos;an.  The diacritical strokes in this manuscript and in pl. 45 b are more defined than those in O.I. 6975 a.  Surah division does not occur in this text, but Ar. Pal. pl. 45 b shows the title and number of verses at the head of Surah 61 in large, heavy Kufic with letters freely extended.  A triangular scroll ornament follows in the margin.  A single stroke in black ink marks the ends of the verses in both pieces.  An initial h marks off groups of 5 verses; in recto 5, it indicates the end of verse 15 in the manuscript, but the middle of verse 15 in the printed text.
