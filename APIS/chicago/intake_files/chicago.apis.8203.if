cu500_pal | 1 | In line 1, the readings 1/6 or 2 are both possible, but hedj followed by a whole number X must be understood as "X silver (deben)," an enormous sum compared to the following fractions of kite.  In line 3, the number following the sign for kite looks more like 1 than 1/2, but the latter is the sum of the two preceding fractions, 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2.  The season name peret is also possible, giving the month Mecheir.
