cu300 | 1 | Ostracon ; 8.0 x 8.6 cm
cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 20; Nelson collection no. N275.  1/3 silver (kite) 1 1/4 (ob.) equals 5 1/4 obols, presumably 1 1/2 obols for the salt tax at the normal female C rate, introduced in year 5 of Ptolemy III, and 3 3/4 obols for the wool tax.  The scribes Petechonsis (son of Psenthotes) and Osoroeris, son of Horos are also attested together on O. Leiden AES 30 (Nur el-Din 1974), a receipt for salt and wool taxes dated to year 5 by the editor, but which Muhs prefers to date to year 15.  1/2 silver kite 1 3/4 (ob.) is 7 3/4 obols, presumably 4 obols for the salt tax at the normal male C rate, introduced in year 5 of Ptolemy III, and 3 3/4 obols for the income of a server tax.
