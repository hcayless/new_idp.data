cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 46; Nelson collection no. N306.  The divine determinative at the end of the father&apos;s name rules out the possibility of reading Pa-rt and thus identifying this taxpayer with Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6, Amenothes, son of Parates.  However, it may be possible to identify this taxpayer with the pastophoros Amenothes, son of Pathotes, whose mother is Ta-mti.  He is a contractor in the divorce contract P. Phil. dem. 11 (el-Amir 1959), dated to year 4 Tybi of Ptolemy II.  The scribe Paches was responsible for several other yoke tax receipts and perhaps one nht-tax receipt from Thebes between years 11 and 16, probably of Ptolemy II.  (See additional OIM ostraca.)

cu500_pal | 1 | The nh-group at the beginning of the tax name is clear, the rest is not, but the scribe Paches is a well-known Theban yoke tax scribe.  The season name is perhaps shemw rather than peret, though even akhet is possible, and the day number is perhaps 16 rather than 18.
