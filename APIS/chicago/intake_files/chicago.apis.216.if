cu500 | 1 | Number 89 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  This oath is complementary with MH 4024 (#90 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication), one from Daniel to Mark, the other from Mark to Daniel.  They indicate that the two men had a partnership of some kind.  The sherds used are of the same type, and the handwriting suggests that the two were written by one person.  For field reference, see Hoelscher OIP 21, pl. 32.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
