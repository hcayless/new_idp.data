cu500_pal | 1 | Clear and carefully executed Meccan script.  The ink, originally dark, is unevenly faded into various shades of brown.  Single and group letters are separated by as much as 1 cm and words are frequently divided at the end of a line.  Diacritical strokes are used freely.  It is possible that the letter numerals in this text are of a later date than the text, for the letters and their circles are drawn with a wavering and uncertain hand, and the ink has taken on a more reddish tint in fading.
