cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 54; Nelson collection no. N315.  If the reading of Amenrosis in line 1 is correct, then this is presumably the Overseer of the Necropolis Amenrosis, son of Totoes, known from many other burial tax receipts from Thebes between years 18 and 26, presumably of Ptolemy II. He rarely signed his own receipt, but the scribe Pauris(?)... is otherwise unknown.  1/2 silver kite was the usual payment to the Overseer of the Necropolis for the burial tax on the interment of one individual in the necropolis during the reign of Ptolemy II.
