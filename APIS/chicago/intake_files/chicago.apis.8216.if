cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 41; Nelson collection no. N301.  Paches, son of Parates is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 28.  1/4 silver (kite) 3/4 obols is 3 3/4 obols. Very little of the tax name at the end of line 1 is preserved before the break.  "Wool tax" (hedj inshen) fits the rate, but not the male taxpayer or the traces.  However, "income of a man who serves" (aq rmt iw=f shms) fits both the rate and the male taxpayer and it may be possible to read "income" (aq) before the break.  Muhs could not suggest a plausible reading for the beginning of line 2.  It may be the name of a second tax since the following year date probably indicates the period for which the tax(es) were paid.
