cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 37; Nelson collection no. N296.  The Greek names Amenoth and Tsemmont probably represent the names of Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6, Amenothes, son of Parates, and Taxpayer 19, Senmonthis, daughter of Amenothes.  The Greek names lack declensional endings, which is not unusual in Theban salt tax receipts before c. 250 B.C. and fits with the suggestion that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian.  The normal A rate (before fiscal year 32 of Ptolemy II) for the salt tax is 3/4 kite (1 dr. 3 ob.) for men and 1/2 silver kite (1 dr.) for women, so this must be a semi-annual payment, well attested during the period of the A rate.  The scribe Horos, son of Esminis is known from two other salt tax receipts (O. BM 20265 and 5768; Wangstedt 1978-79) and may also have been Witness 10 on P. Wien 6052 (Bresciani 1969).  He is probably not to be identified with a similarly named man, possibly his grandfather, who was Witness 12 on P. Rylands dem. 10 (Griffith 1909), Witness 3 and Witness-copyist 5 and 4 on P. Phil. 3 and 4 (el-Amir 1959), and Witness 1 on P. BM 10528 (Glanville 1939).

cu500_pal | 1 | Both the Greek (lines 1, 5-6) and Demotic (lines 2-4) texts are written with a brush rather than a reed pen.  The method of writing suggests that the scribe of the Greek text was an Egyptian (see OIM 19326), probably the same Egyptian scribe who wrote the Demotic text, and indeed the other salt tax receipts signed by Horos, son of Esminis also bear short Greek texts.
