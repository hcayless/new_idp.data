cu500_pal | 1 | Small, easily legible cursive script.  The scribe, who was trying to save space, separated the conjunctive "waw" from the following word and split a number of words at the ends of lines.  Diacritical points appear more frequently on the verso than on the recto and are carefully placed, especially in names.  The circle without a dot is used for punctuation, but is missing at the end of Tradition 10.
