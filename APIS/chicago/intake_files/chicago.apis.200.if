cu500 | 1 | Number 67 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  The phrase &apos;&apos;demosios logos&apos;&apos; in line 2 is, in Greek usage, the state treasury (fiscus) or the official in charge of it.  It can also denote the local treasury of a township.  In the Coptic documents from Aphrodito (PLond IV), it designates the Muslim governor of Egypt.  In this text, the lacunae obscure the meaning.  &apos;&apos;Hene,&apos;&apos; in line 3, is a word of unknown meaning that occurs in connection with clothing.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
