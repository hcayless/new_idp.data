Lord of awe; who is fragrant [of aromas; who is gracious] (3) when he comes. Who makes flourish the herbage for cattle; [who provides sacrificial beasts for] (4) each god. (Though?) he is in the netherworld, heaven and earth are under [his authority. Who takes possession of the Lands] (5) Two. Who fills storehouses; who makes granaries bulge; [who gives the] (6) the possessions of the poor. Fourth month of winter, day 25 (?). Who causes to flourish [desirable woods] (7) of every sort, so that there shall never be lack of them.

Water for everybody is] (5) drunk [through him. Who gives] excessively through (6) his goodness. Who has been in [constriction]; who issues forth in (7) gladness.
