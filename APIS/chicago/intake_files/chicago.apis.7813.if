cu500_lin | 1 | On recto and verso: 12 lines each in Arabic
cu500_pal | 1 | Small, but graceful Meccan script with comparatively long vertical strokes.  The ink must have been originally a light or medium brown because the recto is so faded that it looks blank and can be read only with great difficulty.  The verso shows a light and a dark shade of brown.  Vowel points are wanting, but diacritical strokes are freely used.  There is a note written in red in the margin of verso 2; it is in a different and later hand.

cu590_con | 1 | Fine parchment, the length of which is intact, except perhaps for the loss of some of the lower margin.  A considerable part of the width is lost, the original size being approximately 20-22 cm.  What remains is in fair condition except for one large lacuna.
