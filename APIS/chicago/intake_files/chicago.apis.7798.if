cu500_lin | 1 | On recto: 21 lines in Arabic
cu500_pal | 1 | The parchment is a palimpsest, but very few and light traces only are to be seen of the underscript.  The script is a small cursive hand with some angularity, but on the whole, closer to the regular naskhi hand.  The text is freely though not completely pointed and is not voweled except for one instance in line 9.  The words are closely written, but not crowded in line spacing.  Most of the signatures are in a crude and unpracticed hand.  The same ink--a medium brown--is used for the main document and by the witnesses.

cu500_t | 1 | P. O.I. A6966, recto: (1) In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  (2) This is what Qalhash, son of Boqtor, bought from Marqurah, son of Kail, of the inhabitants of Abu al-Jusuq, known as Bursh.  (3) He bought from him and from his mother, Aqtahun, (daughter) of Ibn Abi Tidur, their house in Abu al-Jusuq Bursh of the district of the (4) Fayyum for eight dinars, of which one dinar is debased and seven dinars unadulterated, sound (5) full weight by the new mithqals.  And it is the house whose southern boundary extends to the house of Matus, son of Dahlan, and its (6) northern boundary (is) the house of the heirs of Bani Qasa, and its eastern boundary the house of Faqri, son of Shinudah, and its western boundary the house of (7) Tusanah, daughter of Bisanti.  Qalhash, son of Boqtor, bought from Marqurah, son of Kail, and from his mother, Aqtahun, (daughter) of Ibn Abi Tidur, their right (8) in the house delimited and described by the four boundaries that surround it to the limit of all its boundaries, and every (9) right pertaining to it, entering in it, and issuing from it, for these eight dinars specified in this deed.  (10) And Qalhash, son of Boqtor, delivered it to Marqurah, son of Kail, this entire sum in full payment, and he receipted him with a receipt for full payment received.  (11) And they were satisfied and parted on terms of mutual satisfaction on their part.  And they consulted (with each other) in accordance with the Muslim law of sale and its stipulations without option for either of them and without annulment.  (12) These are the terms on which they concluded the sale.  And whatsoever should ensue to Qalhash, son of Boqtor, by way of damages or claims or attachments from anyone whatsoever (13) for any reason whatsoever or in any manner whatsoever--the responsibility for that and security for it rests on Marqurah, son of Kail.  And that (14) in Safar of the year six and thirty and three hundred.  &apos;Ali, son of Ibrahim, al-Aswani, gave witness to that, to all that is in this deed (15) in Safar of the year six and thirty and three hundred.  Muhammad, son of al-Qasr, gave witness to that, to all that is in this deed, and &apos;Ali, son of Ibrahim, wrote (signed) for him (16) by his order and in his presence.  (17) Muhammad, son of al-Husain, gave witness to all that is in this deed and wrote with his own hand.  (18) Ahmad, son of al-Khashram, testified to all that is in this deed and wrote with his own hand.  (19) Fasau(?), son of Ahmad, gave witness to all that is in this deed, and &apos;Ali, son of Ibrahim, wrote for him by his order and in his presence.  (20) Ahmad, son of Muhammad, gave witness to all that is in this deed.  (21) &apos;Ali, son of Husain, gave witness to all that is in this deed and wrote his testimony with his own hand.
