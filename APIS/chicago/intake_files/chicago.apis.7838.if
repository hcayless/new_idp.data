cu500 | 1 | Text area measures 13 x 20 cm.  Dark reddish-brown leather covers board made of layers of old manuscripts.  The inside is lined with thin dark leather with an allover arabesque.  The outside shows a gold-tooled central medallion consisting of geometric figures built around a 6 pointed star.  The figures form a 12 pointed star inscribed within a circle, outside of which are 12 lobes, 10 of them semi-circular, their outer edges bordered by a twist with "finials."  The other 2 lobes, at the top and bottom, are each modified into a pointed arch from the point of which projects a sort of fleur-de-lis.  The corner designs harmonize with the outer elements of the central medallion.  What may be a much simplified plant motif is used in the rectangular frame of the cover.
