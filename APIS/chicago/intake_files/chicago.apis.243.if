cu500 | 1 | Number 385 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  Tax money is designated as &apos;&apos;arithmia&apos;&apos; (&apos;&apos;reckoned&apos;&apos;), meaning currency reckoned at its theoretical value, in contrast to &apos;&apos;echomena,&apos;&apos; which denotes the actual value of the coins.  (See Bell p. 84-86 versus West and Johnson p. 120 and 128.)  &apos;&apos;Dapane,&apos;&apos; in line 4, is the name for this particular type of tax levied to cover the expenses of local officials.  &apos;&apos;Katabole,&apos;&apos; in line 4, is the term for a partial payment, as two installments were allowed on an annual tax.  For field reference, see Hoelscher OIP 21, pl. 32.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
