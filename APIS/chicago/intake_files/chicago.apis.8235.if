cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 60; Nelson collection no. N354.  1/2 silver kite was the usual payment to the Overseer of the Necropolis for the burial tax on the interment of one individual in the necropolis in the reign of Ptolemy II.  (See additional OIM ostraca.)  In line 2, it is possible to read Ta-sheret-pa-sher-na-netjerew as a single name, but it is otherwise unattested.  Other burial tax receipts identify the deceased only in relation to a male relative.  See O. BM 5785 (Wangstedt, Or Suec 23-24, 12-13 [4]) for "the sister of Pamonthes the doctor" and O. Brook. 37.1856 (Malinin, Melanges Mariette 1961, 149 [5]) for "the mother of Psenminis son of Hetep-..., the priest of Sobek."  The scribe Petemestous, son of Poulemis(?) was responsible for many other burial tax receipts and one burial plot receipt from Thebes between years 20 and 24 of Ptolemy II.  (See additional OIM ostraca.)
