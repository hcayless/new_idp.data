cu300 | 1 | 15 papyri ; 1029.0 cm x 30.6 cm
cu500 | 1 | Undated.  Presented by Mrs. Elizabeth Milbank Anderson.  Spiegelberg first noted that P. Milbank (M) was a Ptolemaic text in a letter dated 27 June 1922 to James H. Breasted.  Spiegelberg&apos;s dating was based on P. Milbank&apos;s resemblance to T, the Turin BD published by Lepsius in 1842.  On plate LX of the latter is a demotic marginal note, clearly Ptolemaic (see Spiegelberg in ZAS LVIII [1932] 152 ff).  Georg Moeller, cited by Spiegelberg, would date T more exactly to the 2nd-1st century BC.  Naville, too, at least as early as 1904, had believed T to be &apos;&apos;of the Ptolemaic epoch&apos;&apos; (see his introduction to P. le Page Renouf, The Book of the Dead: Translation and Commentary, Paris and Leipzig, 1907, p. clii).  The name of M&apos;s beneficiary is not a certain clue, for it is of a type that begins by the 26th dynasty.  The fine lines of the writing, however, are more definite.  (Allen p. 40);There are vignettes associated with BD 1, 17, 16, 18, 21, 23-8, 30, 64, 31-3, 36, 38-41, 74-5, 77-88, 72, 54, 56, 59, 52, 44, 63, 45, 50, 47, 93, 43, 89, 91-2, 98, 100-2, 94, 104, 68, 71, 105-6, 108, 110, 113, 111, 114-5, 124, 119, 125, 112-3, 125-6, 129, 140, 63, 138-9, 133-4, 102, 143-50, 92, 154, 151-2, 155-62.;BD 16 consists of a vignette only between lines 133 and 134.  For discussions of similar scenes, see K. Sethe, &apos;&apos;Altaegyptische Vorstellungen vom Lauf der Sonne,&apos;&apos; in Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philos.-hist. Klasse, Sitzungsberichte, 1928, p. 259-84 and H. Schaefer, ZAS 71 (1935), 15-38.  BD 110c is a vignette only, arranged in four registers, each under its own sky.  At the top, Khepri squats enshrined on a bark behind which squat Isis and Nephthys.  In the next panel, the deceased stands praying while Harpocrates presents offerings to the enthroned Osiris flanked by standing Isis.  In each of the bottom two registers, the deceased kneels while presenting offerings to two squatting gods.  BD 110b (lines 597-600) also consists of four registers.  (597) The contents are in disorder and some of its legends are unreadable.  Deceased, kneeling with a tree behind him, presents a bundle of flax (see Gardiner&apos;s Grammar M 37 f) to the Sun-god in his bark.  A second, smaller bark bears a deity with ;an inverted basket; for a head.  (cf. a similar scene in vignette BD 17 of BM 10470 (Ani, pl. 10), where the gods are Khepri and Atum respectively.)  The hieroglyphs at left include a horizon sign, three city signs, and possibly the words &apos;&apos;his phoenixes.&apos;&apos;  (598) Deceased plows, reaps, and ;binds sheaves; before three squatting sungods.  The hieroglyphs at left repeat in part signs used in top register.  (599) Deceased threshes.  A tree precedes the bark of Osiris, above which is written &apos;&apos;His name is the Good God.&apos;&apos;  Two unnamed gods squat at left.  (600-603) The bottom register consists of two islands at right, which display respectively the words &apos;&apos;He whose name is (destined) to (be) Lord of the Gods&apos;&apos; (Or emend initial &apos;&apos;nty&apos;&apos; to &apos;&apos;aa&apos;&apos; and translate &apos;&apos;<Greater is> his name than (that of) the lord of the gods&apos;&apos;?) and the figures of three squatting deities.  Toward these deceased is poling a papyrus skiff.  The inscription at left, resembling that at right, says perhaps &apos;&apos;He whose Name is (destined) to (be) Lord{s} of the Gods, the Pig, and the 3000 Snakes.&apos;&apos;  (Or emend as before and translate &apos;&apos;<Greater is> his Name than (those of) the lords of the gods, the pig (Seth?), and the 3000 snakes&apos;&apos;?)  For lines 660-701, P. Milbank has the same sequence as T, but in reverse order, except that P. Milbank omits 25 and repeats 29 at the end (which should have been thebeginning).  For this reason, 660-701 are translated here in reverse order, since they were evidently reversed in writing.  BD 143 is a vignette only located between BD 130 and 144.  In P. Milbank, the top and bottom registers of the five registers found in P. Ryerson (OIM 9787) are omitted.  BD 150 consists of vignettes further illustrating BD 149.  M&apos;s legend &apos;&apos;Abode of water,&apos;&apos; seems to fit abode 13; the rest are not standard.  M&apos;s forms represent abodes 1, 4, 10, perhaps 11 (or is this legend meant for &apos;&apos;aat (djew qa) aa&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Abode of the two great (high mountains),&apos;&apos; appropriate to abode 4 above it?), 12 (three times), and 15, besides uncertain ones.  In the 2 columns after BD 154, vignettes of BD 151-2 and 155-60 appear, all without text.;Square brackets [ ] denote lost text and lines ; ; indicate uncertain text.  Braces { } denote superfluous words and parentheses ( ) indicate elements supplied, comments or emended text.

(509) Bring me the ferryboat, bring me the ferryboat of the Deep, attach (for) me the towrope, (that I may) go forth (510) thereby, (that I may) detour around yonder shoal, and vice versa.  (When) I come, may there shine for me that egg of mystery, (that I may)  ascend (to) you.  Bring me (511) the ferryboat, attach for me (the towrope), at Re&apos;s ascent, to (cause) that (I) go.  May ye say: &apos;&apos;Bring (him) the ferryboat on the way, (512) attach for him the towrope, (at Re&apos;s ascent,) that he may become powerful thereby, that he may circle to (this) his path.  His Soul ascends to know his (Father) Re (at) his setting, (it being) in his train.  (513) He exists in the west, (while) all the gods serve (him).&apos;&apos;  The egg that is in secret shines for me.  There has been brought to me the ferryboat of the Deep, and the towrope has been attached for (me), (that I may) go forth (514) thereby (515) every day.  (516) &apos;&apos;TELL ME MY NAME,&apos;&apos; SAYS THE MOORING PIN.  TO BE SAID BY OSIRIS IRTYWRW JUSTIFIED: LADY OF THE TWO LANDS (AND OF) WORK IS THY NAME.  (517) &apos;&apos;TELL ME MY NAME,&apos;&apos; SAYS THE MAL(LET).  TO BE SAID BY OSIRIS IRTYWRW JUSTIFIED: UPLIFTED ?BY? (THESE) GODS IS YOUR NAME.

(523) &apos;&apos;TELL ME MY NAME,&apos;&apos; (SAY) WATER (AND) WOOD.  TO BE SAID BY OSIRIS IRTYWRW JUSTIFIED: JUDGE IS YOUR NAME.  (524) Hail to you, lords of truth, void of falsehood, who stay alive forever (for) the periods to eternity.  Separate ye me (from the earth), for I am blessed (with) (525) your form and in control of your  magic and esteemed as ye are esteemed.  (R)escue ye me from (the crocodile) who is in (this land of) the Two Truths.  Give ye (526) to me my (mouth), that (I) may speak therewith.  Oblations are given me in your presence, because I know you (every) day and know the name of that great god (527) at (whose) nose ye place provisions.  His name is (T)ekem.  He has access to the western horizon of the sky; he has access to the {his} eastern horizon of the sky.  If he goes, I go, and vice versa; (if he stays sound,) (528) I stay sound, and vice versa.  Ye shall not eject me from the mesqet-region, and transgressors shall not prevail over (me).  (529) (BD 100) SPELL FOR EMBARKING IN THE BARK OF RE.  (530) I FERRY the phoenix to Abydos, Osiris (531) to Mendes.

My (...) is in (my) body; ?water is (in) (537) him who goes to his father?.  I am one who has ascended as (538) your doorkeeper ?to barley and to wheat?.  He has ascended, ?my spell being? upon him.  (539) (BD 101) SPELL FOR ASCENDING TO THE BARK OF RE.  (540) O Re in this thy name of Re, if (541) thou passest by thy flood (in) thy bark, (I) go forth (542) with thee.  Behold, I am gone forth (behind thee), (543) Re.  See, I am going forth to thee to thy Bark.  (544) (BD 94) SPELL FOR (OBTAINING THE PALETTE).

(559) (BD 71) SPELL FOR (GOING FORTH BY) DAY AND REPULSING ?THE SWALLOWER?.  (560) O falcon who risest (from) the deep, (lord) (561) of the Great Flood, mayest thou keep me sound just as (562) thou keepest thy(self) sound.  Mayest thou (loose me), (mayest thou free me.  Put me d)own.  &apos;&apos;Grant (563) his desire,&apos;&apos; (says) he who came forth from thee.  (O) falcon, (564) when thou risest, mayest thou keep me sound just as thou keepest thyself sound.

(578) O (thou) Great of provisions, O Great One pre(579)siding over the upper houses, (ye) who give bread {bread} and beer to the gods in his presence, (590) he has commanded that ye give him bread and beer day and night (on) going forth (591) from Memphis.  He has gone to the house of Re.  (592) He shall not be kept away from (any) gate that he may wish to approach (on) going forth against you.  (593) (BD 108) SPELL FOR KNOWING THE SOULS OF THE WEST.

The gods serve him (when) (586) Re goes forth and has entered (therein).  Sobk, (lord) of the eastern range, shall see Hathor, lady of the eastern range.  (I) shall not be seized (when) (587) Atum goes forth, (for) I know the name(s) (and) I know the (588) name(s) of your 7-cubit Souls who are ascended to him in his broad hall.  Re shines upon him when he is in the west of the sky.

(593) (I) KNOW the name(s) of the gods ?whom ye (know)?, (for) I am one who has come forth from them.

(616) I am one who came forth from Atum, one whom he knew (617) (of old).  He is one whom (618) the Ennead illumines as he rejoices.  I am one who is seen with you.  (619) (BD 114) KNOWING THE SOULS OF HERMOPOLIS.  (620) ?A THRUST.?  (621) Verily the Deep ASCENDS; god goes (621) with god.  Re ascends to his horizon; (622) he knows him who is in his gate, (for) he has seen his corpse.  (623) The dweller in Hermopolis rises (for) him and sets for him.  They ascend through his (gate) to the day.  (624) (BD 115) SPELL FOR KNOWING THE SOULS OF HELIOPOLIS.  (625) I am one who grew large yesterday.  (I) know (626) him whose hands serve me (when) he has ascended.  I am (627) Re (when) he ascends from his horizon.  (I) know (628) against whom the gods go forth (in) going forth from the sky.  (629) SPELL FOR GOING FORTH TO THE SKY (AND TO) THE GODS OF THE NETHER SKY.  (630) I am one in whose behalf Re GOES FORTH at (whatever) gate he will (when) he sets.  (631) (O) ye gods with whom he has gone, I am one who has ascended to the (632) sky with Re.  Serve me, all gods, (for I am) on (633) his throne (and) Re encircles (my) (image).  (634) (BD 116) Knowing the Souls of Heliopolis.  (635) (I) KNOW you (and) him who has ascended with you.  (636) Ye see me ?(ascended)? to the place which he desires (and) on (637) (his) seat.  The god ?comes?; he knows what is (in) their bodies.  (638) He has gained access to the way to the west.  (When) he ascends, I (a)m ascended ?(with him)?.  (639) (BD 124) SPELL FOR GOING DOWN TO THE COUNCIL of Osiris.  (640) (My) Soul BUILDS its throne in Mendes ?(be)fore? (641) the Elders (when) I ascend (to) the place (whither) one has ascended.  (O thou) who circlest (642) for him and shinest for him, come to me, (for) I am (643) one who has ascended (and) I know my ?destiny?.  (644) (BD 117) SPELL FOR TAKING THE ROAD.

(I have) come unto thee, Osiris, that (I) may praise thee and wash away thy efflux which went forth (647) from Rosetau.  The road of my face is (that of) Rosetau.  I go in and out of Rosetau.  (648) (BD 119) SPELL FOR GOING FORTH FROM ROSETAU.  (649) THE ROAD OF MY FACE is toward Rosetau.  I am one who has gone forth from Rosetau.  I have brought offerings (650) to Abydos.
