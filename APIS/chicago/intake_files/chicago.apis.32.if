cu500_pal | 1 | The script is the fairly careful book hand or &apos;&apos;naskhi &apos;&apos; of the early Islamic centuries employed largely by copyists, a more or less cursive type with the letters generally well formed. Diacritical marks not fully used throughout the text, though used on many words. &apos;&apos;Fa&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;qaf&apos;&apos; receive a dot below and above, respectively, as was the practice with some of the earliest papyrus documents. The punctuation device for a full stop - a circle surrounded by a number of dots - is also true to early practice.
