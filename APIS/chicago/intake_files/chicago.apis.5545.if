(Allen, p. 31)  Gardiner preferred a First Intermediate Period date (c.2190-2061 B.C.).  (See Willems, p. 246, n. 24.)  Mathieu dates it to the end of dynasty 6 and cites other scholars&apos; datings, as well.  (See BdE 139, p. 254 and n.59-60.)  Dates follow D.B. Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).  The numbers for the entire papyrus are OIM 14059-87.  See Lesko (p. 74) for a list of spell numbers in P. Gardiner III and corresponding line numbers.  P. Gardiner II in the British Museum also contains hieratic coffin texts and may be dated to the same period as this text.

OIM 14079, recto:  (Sp.288) (424)I am a flame (moving) before the wind to the end of the sky and the end of the earth, I travel [the air] and traverse [the ea]rth...on the eastern side of the celestial vault (425)...the sky...at dawn, I am he who divides the storm.  (Sp.989) (426)...of the great storm-cloud [go forth(?)] from the horizon, the inner apartment of Her who bore the gods on... (429)...as this her great and mighty [new]er-fish(?) which is in the sky...within the god&apos;s tamarisk[-clump(?)] (430)which enfolds Thoth when Isis comes, and she says: &apos;Semen shall be destroyed for you and...before your days have come.&apos;  (431)[What] is to be done about this?  The god shall ejaculate semen and...I will have brought to you this iron which is in the bow of the bark of Henew.  (432)...arms of Khepri... (434)...who is among the gods.  O...you shall guide him who has served you, and I will fly up as...the plumes of Henew shall be given to you (435)and their...shall be on top of Henew.  The south-wind shall be given to you for your henchman and the north-wind for your nurse; the plume of the Beauteous One shall be tied on her sister.  (436)...which is between them both.  I will make ascents to the horizon, for I reached the horizon as a uraeus when I was born.
