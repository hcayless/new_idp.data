cu500_pal | 1 | The script is a light, but well-schooled book hand used at the time for smaller Qur&apos;ans and occasionally for other valued works of a religious and linguistic character.  On the surface, it bears a resemblance to the so-called kufic-naskhi of the third century A.H. in the angularity of letters associated with the kufic script and the cursiveness of letters credited to the naskhi script.  On the other hand, the script bears a marked resemblance to the Christian Arabic writing of the same century evolving in the Asiatic provinces and influenced by the Syriac script, especially in the tendency to give vertical strokes a bit of the wave that is found in the Syriac script.  Upon closer analysis of the letters&apos; forms, this script finds no close parallel in either the Islamic or Christian book hand now extant.  This is not surprising given the very old date of this manuscript.  Diacritical points are used sparingly except in the first few lines.  When a letter calls for two or three points, these are neither consistently grouped together, nor are they accurately placed above or below the letter.  The vertical stroke of the alef and the l are written downward, regardless of the letters&apos; position in the word.
