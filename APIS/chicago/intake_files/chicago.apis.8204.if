The scribe Petemestous, son of Poulemis(?) was also responsible for many burial tax receipts and one burial plot receipt from Thebes between years 20 and 24 of Ptolemy II.  Amenothes, son of Parates is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 6.  1/2 silver kite was the usual payment to the Overseer of the Necropolis for the burial tax on the interment of one individual in the necropolis in the reign of Ptolemy II and hence 1 silver kite for the interment of two individuals.  For another burial tax receipt in which the deceased may be designated a "man of the tomb of the town" (pa rmt ta st tmy), see DO Louvre 74 (Devauchelle 1983), although the editor took Ta-st-tmy as a toponym.
