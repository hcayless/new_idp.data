cu500_pal | 1 | Small, carefully executed book hand that is more cursive than angular.  Diacritical points are for the most part sparingly used.  Punctuation and collation marks consist of two concentric circles with a dot at the center.  Dashes are used to separate headings within a given section, and some sections are set apart by the space of a line.  The line canceling the heading in verso 34 indicates that the scribe decided to start the section on ablution on the next page.
