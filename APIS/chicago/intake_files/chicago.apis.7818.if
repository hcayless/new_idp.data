cu500_pal | 1 | Small and poor Meccan(?) script, with a very slight slant, the characters written close together in brown ink that has faded somewhat.  The script has some characteristics in common with O.I. A6988 and O.I. A7000.  Diacritical strokes are used fully and freely and red vowel dots are also used.  A red semicircle is used for hamzah in recto 5 and verso 1 & 5.  If this hamzah is sounded with an a, the sign is placed above the letter, if with an i, it is placed below the letter.  A red horizontal stroke below the line is used for waslah in verso 9, while the same stroke above a letter is used for maddah in verso 4.  A red circle is used with the unpointed letters over s in verso 3.
