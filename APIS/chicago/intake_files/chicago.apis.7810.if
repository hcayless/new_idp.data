cu500_pal | 1 | Originally, this papyrus was used for correspondance of some type and was written in a large, well-spaced script.  One phrase of the original text has survived, along with the bismallah.  The writer of the hadith began at the bottom of the reverse and continued on the top of the obverse.  The script is a fairly fixed, small cursive hand, using two different kinds of ink.  The light brown ink of the upper part of the recto has faded considerably, in constrast to the more lasting almost black ink of the rest of the text.  Diacritical points are used, but vowels are rarely used.
