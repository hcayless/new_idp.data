cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 59; Nelson collection no. N320.  Senmonthis, daughter of Amenothes is Muhs&apos; Taxpayer 19.  The normal female A rate (before fiscal year 32 of Ptolemy II) for the salt tax is 1/2 silver kite, so this must be a semi-annual payment, well attested during the period of the A rate.  The scribe Teos may also have been responsible for the Theban tax receipt O. BM 19953 (Wangstedt , Or Suec 27-28 (1978-79): 11-12 [6]), dated to year 23, Phaophi 22, for the salt tax of year 22.  The editor read the scribe&apos;s name as Hor-wedja, but Djed-hor appears more likely.

cu500_pal | 1 | The reading of the Greek in line 3 is very doubtful.  The symbol of 2 phis and 2 iotas seems plausible, but the rest is speculation based on the Demotic date.
