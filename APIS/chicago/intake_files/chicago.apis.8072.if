cu500 | 1 | Number 296 in Stefanski&apos;s and Lichtheim&apos;s publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  "Syllogrin" is perhaps derived from the Greek "syllogarion," which apparently means "supplement."  Lichtheim was uncertain to what the word "dioikesis" referred and whether it could denote tax in general.  For a further explanation of the word this term, see R. Bagnall, Agricultural Productivity and Taxation in Later Roman Egypt, Transactions of the American Philological Association, vol. 115, 1985, p. 291 and D.W. Rathbone, Review of: Confiscated Property, Eine Steuerliste aus Pheretnuis (P. Pher.) by P.J. Sijpesteijn and K.A. Worp, The Classical Review, vol. 45, no. 1, 1995, p. 146.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.
