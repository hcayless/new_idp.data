cu500 | 1 | Catalogue no. 19; Nelson collection no. N274.  For a virtually identical text, see O. BM 5702 (Wangstedt 1981), also dated to year 27, Phaophi 27.  (Muhs has corrected the original reading of day 17 to day 27.)  The speaker is the same as in O. BM 5702, which the editor read as Pa-rt sa Pay-&apos;w, but Muhs prefers to read Pa-rt sa Iw=f-aw in both cases.  At the end of line 2, Muhs would like to read herew ("days") as does the editor of O. BM 5702, but the word is not clear in either text.  The scribe is the same as in O. BM 5702, which the editor reads as Pa-bay, but the first sign is clearly a short Pa.
