cu500_pal | 1 | On the verso (page 2) is a crude drawing in heavy strokes of thick blue-green ink that has grayed with time.  This seems to have been filled in later with white paint, which when mixed with the ink gives the latter a greenish-blue shade.  It is barely possible that a name or short phrase is worked into the strokes on the left side.  The misproportioned and dwarfed figure shows the outline of the head, short thick neck, folded arms, and feet that point out sideways in a straight line.  Later attempts to wash out the outline of the head were unsuccessful and have left the paper damaged and slightly crinkled from the rubbing.  The face is pierced through, probably intentionally, leaving a fair-sized hole.  An ornament on the top left corner of the opposite page seems to be drawn in the same ink that was used for this figure.  Roughly circling the head of the figure are some short phrases written upside down.  The three phrases are written in a poor script, with uneven strokes, and in the same shade of ink
