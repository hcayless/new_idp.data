                     <note type="general">See also OIM Photo 27338.  Measurements not given.  Undated.  Allen questioningly dated this papyrus to the 6th dynasty (c.2374-2191 B.C.).  (Allen, p. 31)  Gardiner preferred a First Intermediate Period date (c.2190-2061 B.C.).  (See Willems, p. 246, n. 24.)  Mathieu dates it to the end of dynasty 6 and cites other scholars' datings, as well.  (See BdE 139, p. 254 and n.59-60.)  Dates follow D.B. Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).  The numbers for the entire papyrus are OIM 14059-87.  See Lesko (p. 74) for a list of spell numbers in P. Gardiner III and corresponding line numbers.  P. Gardiner II in the British Museum also contains hieratic coffin texts and may be dated to the same period as this text.  In Spell 943, lines 82(b-c) and 90(e-f) are repeated as refrains after the subsequent lines.  In Spell 945, lines 95-216 comprise a list in tabular form in the following layout: 95, 96-109, 110, 111-124, 125, 126-147, 148, 149-170, 171, 172-193, 194, 195-216.  Lines 95, 125 and 171 contain the copula ''iw'' and lines 110, 148 and 194 contain the possessive pronoun ''i'' + the ''m'' of predication.  These lines apply to the subsequent sentences.  The last two sentences of Spell 543 (line 307) have been written twice, though the first occurrence (the one on the right side) is very damaged.  Spells 961 and 963 (lines 320 and 325-326) are lost.</note>
