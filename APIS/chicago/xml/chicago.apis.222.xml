                     <note type="general">Number 134 in Stefanski's and Lichtheim's publication.  Undated.  Measurements not available.  The meaning of ''katitone'' in line 12 is unknown.  The translation ''then'' in line 13 assumes that ''on'' stands for a meaningless ''oun.''  ''Jeme,'' in line 13, is spelled ''Tjeme.''  In line 15, ''shi'' is probably for ''ji.''  The translation in line 21 is preferable to ''Constantine, son of Tek.''  It was suggested by Crum in a letter to Stefanski.  All ostraca in this volume were on loan from the Egyptian government and had been returned to Egypt by the time of publication.</note>
