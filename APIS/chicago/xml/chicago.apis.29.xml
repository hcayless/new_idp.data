I praise (4) God, than whom there is no other (5) God. Now, Ibshadah ibn Abnilah (6) has informed me that there are owed to him (7) by farmers of the people of your district (8)... and ten dinars, and he claims (9) that they have denied him his right. (10) When this letter has reached you (11) and he has established the proof of what (12) he has told me, then secure (it) for him, (13) and do not oppress your slave. (14) But should his case prove other than (15) that, then write me. (16) Peace be with those who follow (17) the guidance. Written by Muslim ibn (18) Labnan and copied by al-Salt (19) in Safar of the year one (20) and ninety. (Seal) P. O.I. 13756 (P. Qurrah III) verso: (1) From Kurrah ibn Sharik to Basil (2) regarding Ibshadah ibn Abnilah about his farmers (?) (3) [Greek, illegible]</ab>
