            <ab>P. O.I. 13758 (P. Qurrah IV) recto: (1) ... and ... (2) from your land, and I have found it. (3) You still owe a large amount of revenue. (4) You well know what time it has come to be; (5) so appear (6) before me now. By my life, if (7) any finance officer delays (8) beyond the term which I appointed (9) or appears before me having left (10) behind him aught of the revenue, (11) truly, he is but a self-deceiving fool who has light regard for (12) his life. So when there has come to you (13) this my letter, collect what is due from (14) your land of gold tax and (15) imposts and extraordinary taxes. Then come (16) to me with the revenue of your land, together with those (17) whom I had ordered you to bring with you (18) of the people of your land. Now, by my life, (19) I really used to think your administration (20) more successful and better than what (21) I have seen. For you have indeed done what not (22) one of the finance officers has done (23) in the delaying of what is due from you and in (24) the incompetence of your administration. For indeed, (25) by God, there is in my service not one (26) who has delayed this revenue (27) without being disgraced. Let there be no (28) withholding of what is with you. And beware (29) of excuses, for I am not (30) of those who believe in excuses (31) or accept them. Peace (32) be with those who follow the guidance. (33) Written by khalifah on Monday.</ab>
