                     <note type="general">See also OIM Photo 27344.  Measurements not given.  Undated.  Allen questioningly dated this papyrus to the 6th dynasty (c.2374-2191 B.C.).  (Allen, p. 31)  Gardiner preferred a First Intermediate Period date (c.2190-2061 B.C.).  (See Willems, p. 246, n. 24.)  Mathieu dates it to the end of dynasty 6 and cites other scholars' datings, as well.  (See BdE 139, p. 254 and n.59-60.)  Dates follow D.B. Redford (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt (2001).  The numbers for the entire papyrus are OIM 14059-87.  See Lesko (p. 74) for a list of spell numbers in P. Gardiner III and corresponding line numbers.  P. Gardiner II in the British Museum also contains hieratic coffin texts and may be dated to the same period as this text.</note>

            <ab>P. OIM 14067, recto:  (Sp.956) (261)[Shout!] I have taken acclamation, I have ascended to the upper sky of Re, I have fashioned Nekhbet, (262)I [have descended] to the lower sky, I have fashioned Sekhm[et]... (263)...I have nourished Re.  The guardian of the [complete(?)] Vulture... (264)Re lives in me every day; if life be at his nose, life will be at my nose; if he be a noble, I will be a noble; the love of him will be the love of me.  (265)My mother [has installed me] in the midst of herself, because what is disliked is that Seth should see me when I reappear.  O you who are in the Suite, (266)[who see] the young Horus every day as a protection for his Eye, I [will be a child] every day--so says Re of me.  [If I] do not place (267)[him, he will not place me(?)], and Heneg will be astray(?)... (268)...you fear Re and Horus, and Horus is content... (269)the powers of Seth are sealed off(?), and I will be a child--so says Re of me.  He does not place me (270)because I see(?) what Re desires every day...on which Re lives every day...the Mistress of Eternity, [the Mistress of] the limits of the sky, who will not die, perish, be destroyed or come to nothing because of it; (therefore) I will not die, perish, be destroyed or come to nothing.  (271)Re [has installed me] within Nekhbet... (272)[...I have guided my father(?)] Re, and he has given me the year's bread...this my... (273)which is in Nekhbet.  May I ascend to the sky as the young Horus, may I descend to the earth as Shestet, for my wand is mightier than his wand.  I am the heir of eternity, (274)I have passed everlasting.</ab>
