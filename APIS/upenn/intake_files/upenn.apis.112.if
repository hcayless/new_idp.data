cu300 | 1 | 16.2 x 9.5cm. White, thin parchment, written on both faces.  Much faded on the verso side. The full size of the written part of the page, from a very small copy, is preserved but for the four margins, which have been cut off with scissors.
cu500 | 1 | Text is on both sides, 6 lines on Side 1 (Recto) and 6 lines on Side 2 (Verso).  While the script contains some features of the oldest types, it looks decidedly younger. Diacritical signs are expressed by strokes and vowels marked by dots, originally red, now black because of oxidation. (S.L. Skoss?)
