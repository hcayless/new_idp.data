cu500_t | 1 | Lucius Bellenus Gemellus to his son Sabinus, greeting. Aunes the donkey-driver has bought a rotten bundle of hay at 12 drachmae, a little bundle and rotten hay, the whole of it decayed - no better than dung. Sabinus, son of Psellus, of Psinachis, who is with you brought to the city a letter of the praefect Dionysius the strategus telling him to hear... Where did you put the notice of payment for the hay, and the contract for his loan of a mina? Send the key, and let me know where they lie, so that I may get them out in order to have them if I am about to settle accounts with him. Do not neglect these instructions. Take care of yourself. Greet Epagathus and those who love us truly. Good-bye. Choiak 12. Send ten cocks from the market for the Saturnalia, and for Gemella's birthday feast send some delicacies and...and an artaba of wheaten bread. Send the animals to carry manure at the vegetable-ground at Psinachis and the manure-carts, for Pasis is crying out that we must not allow it to be dissolved by the water, and let them fetch his hay. Send the animals at once.  (Grenfell, Hunt & Hogarth)
