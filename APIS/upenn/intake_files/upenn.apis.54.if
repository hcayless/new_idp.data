cu245ab | 1 | Letter of Cyrillus
cu245f | 1 | 2nd CE
cu300 | 1 | 11.9 x 16.2cm.  Mostly intact margins on the top, left and bottom. The right margin has a large gash, with loss of writing from 4-5 lines.
cu500 | 1 | Text is written on both sides: the main text is 13 lines written with the fibers.  On the opposite side, there is one line written against the fibers.  According to Grenfell and Hunt, “this letter is badly written and obscurely worded, and the writer was evidently a person of little culture” (p 262).
cu500_t | 1 | Greeting, Calocaerus: I, Cyrillus, address you. I was not so unfeeling as to leave you without reason; for though a man gets his interest in Tubi tenfold, he still does not recover his capital. I am going up with the dancer; even if he were not going I should not have broken my word. Farewell. (Addressed) Deliver to Calocaerus. (Grenfell & Hunt)
