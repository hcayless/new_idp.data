cu520 | 1 | N»Ìjid b. Muslim lets √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad in this letter know what the people of his district have to pay of the total amount of taxes for the Fayum presumably imposed by the governor (amir). N»Ìjid instructs √¨Abd All»Ìh to send the taxes with N»ÌjidÇ«÷s own messenger, or with the messengers of the villages or with those responsible for the collection and transportation of the taxes so that he can hand over the complete tax-installment (tabl). The remainder of the letter suggests that N»Ìjid wants the people of √¨Abd All»ÌhÇ«÷s district to cover the maintenance costs of someone, presumably the tax-collector sent by him, perhaps the same person as N»ÌjidÇ«÷s secretary mentioned in the letter. The letter is complete and part of the address appears on Verso.;The following documents are addresed to the same recipient: 5558(1); 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
