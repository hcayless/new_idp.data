cu500_t | 1 | Claudius Terentianus to Claudius Tiberianus, his father and lord, very many greetings. Before all else I pray for your health and prosperity, which are my wish. I marvel that after you sailed upcountry you did not write to me about your well-being, but until today I have been anxious because you were indisposed when you left me. Please, then, write me a reply at once concerning your well-being. You will deliver to Tabetheus the letter of the dioiketes for the strategos, and let her make every effort to deliver it to the strategos at once, so that he may reply quickly to what has been written to him. I also was intending to sail up, but until today I have not yet disposed of my affairs, which remain unsettled. And if you know about Nemesianus, where he is staying, write to me, since we are anxious about him too. All my people salute you. Salute all your friends, each by name. (2nd hand) I pray for your good health.;;(Verso) To his most esteemed Claudius Tiberianus from Claudius Terentianus.
