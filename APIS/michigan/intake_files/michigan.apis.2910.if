cu500 | 1 | It is probable that the Cairo dealer, who sold his papyri to the British Museum, obtained them from the Fayum. In fact, as the Cairo dealer sold Greek fragments to the British Museum, and the Fauym dealer only Coptic and Arabic to Mr. Peterson, it seems more than probable that the whole lot was at one time in the hands of the Fayum dealer. The Cairo dealer bought only the Grekk fragments, but whoever made the division overlooked one, which, somewhat broken, came later to Mr. Peterson.

cu500_pal | 1 | The order of the text shows that verso precedes recto in each fragment and this relative position is supported in the Acta fragment by the preservation of the right margin on the verso and the left margin on the recto. In the Matthew fragment there is not enough margin preserved on either side for us to distinguish between binding edge and outer edge. This order, verso-recto, implies that each fragment is from the first half of a quire.;The papyrus of Matthew is thin, of a brown color and smooth surface. The Acta fragment is thicker, has a slightly rougher surface, and its color is grayish brown. The two fragments were not parts of the same double leaf, nor even, as we shall see later, of the same quire, though the whole of one fragment and half of the other came to us as a part of a single purchase, which suggests that they were found together. There are no characteristic differencies in the writing of the two fragments. In the Matthew fragment twenty lines are preserved on the verso and nineteen on the recto. Average number of letters per line is 24 on the verso and 23 on the recto. The figures total approximately the same for the Acta: 25 letters per line on the verso, 26 on the recto. ;The type of writing is a semi-cursive with considerable linking of certain letters. In general the letters are fairly upright and of even size. Phi extends well below the line, and somewhat above. Rho and rarely iota reach below the line. Alpha has a curved loop, except for two cases of the angular form which are enlarged at the beginning of lines. Both forms of kappa occur, but the uncial form is more common and at the beginning of lines it is enlarged. Epsilon regularly reaches well above the following letter. Omicton is of even size except for a couple of enlarged initials. Delta generally forms a ligature with the following letter, thus making the right hand side of the letter incomplete. There is no punctuation by the first hand. There are rather doubtful dots at the ends of lines 13 and 14 of the verso of the Acta. Also, there seem to be two cases of an apostrophe, one after "all" of line 15 of the recto of the Matthew fragment and the other after "oux" of line 18 of the same page. No breathing or accents. Nomina sacra IHS, PRS, PER. One case of correction by a second hand in l. 12 of the Matthew fragment, recto, in slightly paler ink. It is probably contemporary.
