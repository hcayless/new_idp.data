cu590_con | 1 | Medium brown papyrus. The original cutting lines have been preserved at the top and bottom sides, and partially on the left side of the papyrus. The top right and left and the bottom left corners have broken off. Since only opening formulae and blank papyrus were lost in the lacunae, the damage to the text is limited. Only one word is lost at the beginning and end of three lines due to the other lacunae. There are some further small holes in the papyrus that have not damaged the text.
