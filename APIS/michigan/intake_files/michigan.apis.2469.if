cu500_t | 1 | To Maevius Honoratianus, prefect of Egypt, [from] Aurelius [[. . .]] son of Chairemon from the village [of Karanis(?) in the] Herakleides division of the Arsinoite nome. The divine [and royal] constitutions expressly order that a person is not to perform [another] liturgy in [immediate succession] but is to be allowed an interval [of release]. Therefore, most illustrious prefect, since the present officials of [the village of Karanis], contravening the [many(?)] laws decreed [fo]r the preservation of the province and of us its farmers . . ., appointed me [to] guard duty over the wheat in the granary of the village [of Karanis] while I was still sitologos of the harvest of the preceding [2nd year], and now, contrary to all the laws, [I have been named to] a liturgy, the aforesaid sitologia of the harvest, [for the present] 3rd year, I have (by this petition) fled to your feet for refuge, begging [your] most illustrious [Fortune(?)], if it so please, to hear my plea against [them so that] I can [obtain your] aid, my lord, [in order that], thus [released from] this illegal nomination, [I may be able to] discharge without fault the burden of the liturgy previously assigned [to me] and, remaining in my place of abode, to be thankful [to your Fortune(?) forever(?)]. Farewell.;[[. . .]];[- - -] Epeiph 8.;(2nd hand) Take care of the matters referred to you. Column 22, volume 1.
