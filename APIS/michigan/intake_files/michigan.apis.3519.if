cu500_pal | 1 | For a general description of the palaeography, see electronic version of 21 a-m. Lines 1-4 are in the first hand (scribe), and lines 5-10 in the second hand (owner). These two sections are divided by two wedge-shaped signed placed by the scribe below l. 4, where the writer of the second hand left a 1.5 cm. space between his lines and the preceding text. Lines 5-10 also begin 1 cm. to the left of the margin set by the text above (approximately 3.5 cm.). Four symbols (see image) have been placed in the margin opposite lines 5-6, 7-8, 9, and 10, which may indicate approval of separate recipes, or of special uses of a single recipe with different liquids.

cu520 | 1 | Lines 1-4 contain the last four lines of a page of the codex and are the concluding lines of a recipe, as shown by the unusually deep lower margin (5.5 cm.) and the wedge-shaped signs placed by the scribe below the text. Line 3-4 relate to the uses of the plaster, while line 2 may have held the final direction for its composition. The content in ll. 5-11 is uncertain due to the fragmentary state of the papyrus.
