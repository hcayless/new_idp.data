cu500_t | 1 | I, Orseus, son of Harmiysis, my mother being Tausiris, have joined in selling the share that belongs to me of the half share of an old fallen house, inherited from my father, and of the court and all appurtenances held in common and undivided by me and purchaser Psonsneus and others, in Tebtynis, and I have joined in receiving the entire price in full, immediately, from hand to hand, out of the house, and in guaranteeing the sale with every guarantee as aforesaid. My wife Tamieus, daughter of Patynis, gives her consent to the sale and agrees that she will not proceed against it forever or bring any charges, and that no one else shall in her behalf as aforesaid. I, Orseus, wrote for my wife because she is illiterate.
