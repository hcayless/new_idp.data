cu520 | 1 | The amount of text which is preserved, especially after l. 5, is distressingly meager, and the content of the fragment cannot established in detail. The action does come into focus for a moment in lines 3-5: Dionysus is addressing his Bacchantes. In lines 6-7 we see Pan with his reed-pipe in the retinue of Dionysus. In line 10, if the reading proposed is sound, the Bacchantes may be expressing with prostaxon their submission to the god&apos;s will. The followers of Bacchus are named Lenaiai, which makrs the fragment as a piece of late composition.
