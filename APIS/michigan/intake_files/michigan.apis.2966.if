And it made me (want) to flee; for you alone know that I have spent three days sitting while the business is ruined and a(n alloted portion of ?) water is cut off (?). It will take a lot of money at our expense, and the place is not thriving. We do our work. And I tell you that Muhammad is ending his account (?). Bassere, the poor child, I will testify for her.

You are the . . . . . . . . . . . of the place, like the Governor, Abu I-Bishr, may the Lord guide him! while (?) he settles (?) every business which is ours. Salvation in the Lord! And the word of the Lord is this: if she comes to Mallawi (?) then I will send her to him if the Lord is willing.";(Verso): "From your slave."
