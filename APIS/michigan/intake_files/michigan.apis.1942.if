cu500_t | 1 | [- - -] to his brother Panesneous(?), very many greetings. Before all else I pray for your health and make obeisance for you daily in the presence of our lord Sarapis. I wish you to know, brother, that I wrote to you about the toparch and you have written me no reply. Even if he is unwilling make him inform me about all the things that concern me. I send many salutations to my mother and to Thais your wife and to your children - may the evil eye not touch them. Heraiskos salutes you all by name, as do also his nurse and ...odoros and Kalathous.  . . .  salutes you all. I pray for your health.
