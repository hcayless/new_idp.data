cu590_con | 1 | Dark brown papyrus in bad condition and of a bad quality; a big portion is lost at the upper side to the right; it has margins at the top; some final letters at the end of lines can be seen, which gives the impression that no much is lost at the right side. A vertical strip of fibers has been removed at the middle. Fibers are frayed or misaligned or removed at the several parts.  It seems that the papyrus was randomly folded; there are some crystals of sands at the top and bottom to the left; there is a lacuna at the middle to ca. 4 cm from the left edge. There are three small fragments are split off, mostly from the middle. There is a kollesis of ca. 2.5 cm at the left of the papyrus.
