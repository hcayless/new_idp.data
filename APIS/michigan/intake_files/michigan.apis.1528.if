cu500_pal | 1 | The text of this account begins on the right half of the verso, where the writing runs across the fibers, and continues on the left half of the recto, where the writing is parallel with the fibers. The presence of modest margins above and below the text on both sides marks the account as complete. In the upper left portion of the verso are badly faded remnants of another account, and since the first line begins with all(), it is clear that these few lines conclude an account which occupied at least one more column now lost on the left side.

cu520 | 1 | The account contained in this text registers the receipt of payments both in money and in kind made by the grammateus Lucius to the anonymous writer. The payments are spread over the greater part of a year, but the nature of the service rendered is not specified. A word crucial in this connection has been virtually obliterated on the papyrus (line 4).
