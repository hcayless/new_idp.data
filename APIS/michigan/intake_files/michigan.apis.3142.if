cu500_pal | 1 | The hand which wrote the text used a large, well-formed, legible cursive. The writing grows continually smaller on the lower half of the sheet. In addition to the damage described above, the reading of the text in the left side is further complicated by considerable abrasion of the ink at the begining of lines from 13 to end.

cu500_t | 1 | "Herakleides to Nemesion, his dearest friend, greeting. You will do well to lend your support to the associates of Panetbouis, Petesouchos son of Esouris, his brother Petesouchos, Nepheras the bull-burier, the associates of the citizen Nikanor, and Onnophris, until I come to you, since I have much unfinished business up here. I left with Sambous two drachmas for the copy of the letter. Since I ask it of you, you will go to Patunis, son of Malos, and ask him about vine-cuttings. If he gives you any, send them to Sarapion, secretary of the strategos. Farewell. Year . . of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, . . . 11."

The left side of the papyrus has been affected by a vertical series of large and small holes and tears, which become particularly severe in the lower portion of the papyrus. The sheet was folded five times vertically from right to left, and at least once horizontally through the middle.
