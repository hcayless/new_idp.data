cu300 | 1 | 1 papyrus ; original size: 310 x 28 cm
cu500 | 1 | Due to the size of this papyrus roll, its content has been divided in the present database into several cards, one for each column.;The 4 sections of col. I occupy the space of one of the other columns on the recto. Lines 1-2 of section a extend across the full width of the space, whereas the remaining lines of this section arre little more than half as long; at the right of these shorter lines is section c; section b lies below section a, from which it is separated by a heavy horizontal line; section d is at the right of section b, below section c. As most dates of sections a and b have been lost, it is difficult to determine the relationship of section c to sections a and b; section d is certainly the continuation of section b.

I-XII, present accounts of expenditures made by Kronion and his colleague Eutychas, the officials of the record-office (grapheion) of Tebtynis, during the 6th year and the beginning of the 7th year of the Emperor Claudius. In view of their distribution on the papyrus and of their incompleteness, they were probably not compiled for inspection. - Recto, col. I runs from Sept. 3 to Oct. 26, 45 A.D.; this account is continued on the verso
