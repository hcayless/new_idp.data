When I heard that you were <Read: he was?> angry at me, I came to [- - -] and clasped his knees (in supplication). For &apos;Zenodoros&apos; didn&apos;t permit me to go [[to Bia]] &apos;to him&apos;. Now [after learning] the orders [you gave to] Zenodoros, [he] didn&apos;t obey [anymore to] Zenodoros, [but - - -] five scourge-bearing Egyptian men [- - - he] whipped me brutally, so that my skin was even cut through and now [- - -] has <Read: I] have?> been even worse treated by [him]. I was about to run away and go to you [- - -] Zenodoros prevented me (from doing so), in order that the work, he said, may not be [hindered], but he asked me to write word to you. Now [- - -] but, when you will be here, all that happened will be reported to you. For Bia is the one who commits the outrages [- - -] For she(?) makes herself master of us and of that man. May you prosper.;;(Verso);;To Zenon.;(Docket, 2nd hand) Iollas the weaver about addaios and how they have treated him with violence. [Year 29], Daisios 21, in Arsinoe.

cu510 | 3 | Scholl R, C.Ptol.Sklav. II, 205, 1990 -- End of line 3: the restitution e.g. of the ed.pr. ([alla prosegagen]) must be rejected, as the 6th or 7th letter after Zenodoroi is clearly a phi. Line 7: read hos d&apos;an instead of hos an; the restitution e.g. ei]pen must then be rejected. (PH)
