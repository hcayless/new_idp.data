cu520 | 1 | The text is the beginning of a private letter from a certain Mena to his father. We only learn from the remaining part of the letter that the writer acknowledges that he has caused his father certain inconveniences and that the brother have been forced to work in the field. It is unclear whether these are relatives of the writer or whether the letter belongs in the context of a monastery.
