cu500_pal | 1 | Written along the fibers in medium-sized cursive and well-practiced hand. The interlinear spaces are mostly even of ca. 0.8 cm. The letters are ligatured with the characteristics of the 4th Century; the two loops alpha; a V-shaped upsilon; pi with horizontal stroke with serifs two legs; a mall circular omicron. No diacritical marks or abbreviations are attested. Verso has the name of addressee; who mentioned as ‚Ç£mou kurio‚Ç¥ which gives us impression that the letter is from a woman.

cu590_con | 1 | This bright brown scrap of papyrus has the left and top margins; broken off at the right, which seems to be broken as a result of a vertical fold, and lower sides. The preserved text is incomplete but clear. It has a big lacuna at the middle and badly damaged at the bottom; some fibers are frayed at the beginning of the first line.
