cu500_pal | 1 | The writing is rather clear and practiced, especially in the first 6 lines, in which the writing remains very regular. Then it becomes more cursive and irregular, especially in the ligatures and abbreviations, but undoubtedly the coarse pen contributes to increase the irregularity. Plenty of close parallels to this hand may be found in R. Seider, Palaeographie der griechischen Papyri, I 1, Stuttgart 1967, no. 35, Taf. 21 (1st hd.), CPR VII 3 (taf. 2), and P. Oxy. XLIV 3172 (as far as the more cursive part of the document is concerned).;There remains a margin of approximately 2 cm. at the top, at the bottom, and at the left side. To the right

cu590_con | 1 | This light brown papyrus is complete except for the loss of a large piece at the upper left hand corner. The text is also damaged by a number of small abrasions, though the text may easily be restored. This leaf appears to have been cut off on the right side, and there is a kollesis close  to the cut (approximately 0.5 cm. from the right edge) and the loss of minor papyrus fragments renders a calculation of the number of letters lost to the right uncertain, especially in the first line of the text.
