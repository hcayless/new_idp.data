cu500_pal | 1 | The five receipts for syntaximon were written on the recto by the same scribe in a large, elegant, and easy-to-read cursive. The scribe seems first to have set out the three columns across the top: these are the earliest receipts chronologically and a different column was alotted to each tax payer. In col. I, lines 10-20, the writing becomes more and more crowded within the two receipts dated to the reign of Vespasian (nos. 4 and 5), perhaps because by the time of their copying onto the roll, the top of col. II had already received its receipt (nos. 2). A space of 2.5 cm. was left blank at the top for margin, and 2 cm. for intercolumnar spaces. The first column, with right-hand portions of three receipts (nos. 1, 4, 5) is broken at left throughout its length, and at bottom in the middle of the third receipt in the column (no. 5). There is no space between receipts nos. 4 and 5 (lines 10-20); 6.5 cm. was left blank at the right end of line 9 at the close of receipt no. 11, thus separating it from those which follow below. The center column, with one nearly complete receipt (no. 2), is lost only at the bottom margin. The third column preserves the first four to nine letters of another receipt (no. 3).;The five receipts on the verso were written by three different scribes, with the same scribe apparently responsible for nos. 7, 8, 10. The scribes of the verso wrote in a more cramped and more cursive style than the scribe of the recto. The first column breaks off at bottom as another receipt (no. 8) commences. The individual receipts are separated both vertically and horizontally by blank spaces so that each is distinct; the final receipt (no. 10) is the most isolated, set 4.5 cm. below and 4 cm. to the right of the preceding receipt.
