cu520 | 1 | Salt b. al-Muh»Ìjir starts his letter to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad with very extensive opening greetings and blessings. While the lines that follow are only partially legible, Salt seems to write that he was unable to answer √¨Abd All»ÌhÇ«÷s letter asking him to buy him something due to the unavailability of messengers. He then writes in response to another letter from √¨Abd All»Ìh that he bought him two din»Ìrs worth of chick peas as requested. √¨Abd All»Ìh had also asked Salt to pay back a debt of ten din»Ìrs sending his servant Zayd to collect the money. Salt writes that he is only able to send five din»Ìrs with Zayd, the two din»Ìrs worth of chickpeas and three more din»Ìrs in cash. Salt promises to pay back the remaining five din»Ìrs after a trip to Lower Egypt.;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).

cu590_con | 1 | Light brown papyrus. The original cutting lines have been preserved on all four sides. Two large holes at the top and bottom right sides have resulted in the loss of three to four words at the beginning of four lines. There are some smaller holes in the papyrus. Written in black ink with a thin pen, perpendicular to the fibers on Recto, parallel to the fibers on Verso. Two horizontal folding lines have damaged the ink and fibers of several lines at the beginning of the text and one line towards the end of the letter.
