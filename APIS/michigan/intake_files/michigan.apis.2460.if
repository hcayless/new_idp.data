cu500_pal | 1 | Both codex typology and individual letter form place the text early, probably in the fourth or early fifth century. Related to the early date is the absence of dialectic standardization, which makes any restoration virtually impossible, except on an exempli-gratia basis.

cu590_con | 1 | This fragmentary leaf of a codex is broken off on three sides; the recto preserves the right margin, the verso the left. Due to the absence of close parallels, we cannot determine precisely how much text is lost between the end of the recto and the beginning of the verso; but the amount cannot have been great, and probably did not exceed three lines. After restoration, the average line length is 11.5 cm. The extant margin is ca. 1.3 cm., and the original breadth of the sheet was probably about 14 cm. Although the upper and lower margins do not survive, a rough calculation based on the amount of text presumed lost suggests that, when intact, the sheet was approximately 14 cm. high. We are therefore dealing with the smaller square format found in such early Coptic codices as the Gespraeche Jesu, the Mississipi Crosby, and the Achmimic Proverbs.
