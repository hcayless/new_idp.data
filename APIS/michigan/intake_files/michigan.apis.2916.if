cu500_t | 1 | "Greetings, my lord brother Phanias. I put on board four . . . jars of old wine labelled &apos;Phanias". I trust that you long ago reminded Antonius Petron about the fifty drachmas (?). If not, write to him immediately so that the letter arrives before his departure. Also remind Asklepias who is sailing upriver about his fifty. I also put on board the ship which you sent up another three plants. How much do you want me (?) to buy?";Left margin: "To Phanias, secretary of the Harbor of Memphis (tax ?). Four jars."

cu590_con | 1 | Broken off at the top and at the right. There are traces of five vertical folds: four (inward) folds from right to left enclosing the letter, followed by a fifth (outward) fold revealing the address. The whole letter was then folded at least twice horizontally, once in the middle of the address (about line 9 of the letter), and at least once more below line 17, where the papyrus broke, constituting the bottom of the present piece, after which at least another third of the letter was lost.
