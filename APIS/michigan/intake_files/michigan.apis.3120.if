cu500_pal | 1 | The writing, which is in ink, is faint and in places has been obliterated. The letters, which average 5 cm. in height, show both uncial and cursive form. The recto contains 13 columns, each 2.5 - 3 cm. wide and 6 cm. long. The left margin measures 3 cm. and the right 2 cm. The writing begins at the upper edge of the tablet. The columns are divided by irregular lines drawn in ink and are closed by similar lines at the bottom. The lower half of the recto is blank. The verso contains a double row of columns, of which thirteen are in the upper and seven in the lower half. The upper column are from 2.25 to 4.3 cm. wide and average 5.6 cm. long. As on the recto they are separated and closed at the bottom by irregular lines of ink. The left margin here is 1.8 cm. and the right 9 cm. Columns 14 to 20 are arranged so as to cover the lower half of this side of the tablet. The dots indicated after each line in these lower columns appear in the original. The omission of the Coptic letter and the provenance of the tablet indicate that its dialect is Fayumic.
