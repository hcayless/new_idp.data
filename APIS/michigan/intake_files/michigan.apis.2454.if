cu500_t | 1 | [Claudius Terentianus(?) to Claudius] Tiberianus, [his father and lord, very many] greetings. Before all else [I pray for your] health, [which is my] wish. I myself am in good health and make obeisance for you daily in the presence of our lord Sarapis [and the] gods who share his temple. I want you to know that although [I was ordered] to go out on duty in your absence I was [altogether] unable to go down to Neapolis(?). For it was at that time that . . . so violent an attack of illness, and [I was unable] for five days to write to you anything, [not to speak] of going up to you. Nor was any one of us able to pass the camp(?) gate. I give thanks [to the god] that after the five days . . . so great a disturbance(?), in which is was wounded, . . . he found the [transgressors] of the laws . . . . I have recovered from my illness, and I am the more [grateful to you] for coming down . . . .;(remnants of 30 more lines)
