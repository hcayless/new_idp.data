There is no kollesis.;fr. 2: Dark brown papyrus of good quality; broken off at the left as a result of a vertical fold and badly damaged at the right sides; top and bottom margins are preserved.

A tiny black hard soil is being attached to the lower part; there is a vertical lacuna about 7.0 cm from the bottom. There is no kollesis.
