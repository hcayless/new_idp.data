cu500_pal | 1 | The lower margin (2.3 cm) is nearly all intact.  The writing is fairly bilinear and the lines (height about .25 cm, interlinear .3 cm) regularly spaced. the letters have at times a backward slant and tend to be compressed vertically, but the writer, although experienced, does not hold to this consistency. Beta, mu, and xi have distinctively cursive shapes. Both capital and cursive kappa appear. Tau varies from squarish with a serif at the base (for the latter, cf. some examples of eta and nu) to fast and slanting specimens, and pi shows comparable gradations. Omega lacks the center vertical, and omicron is sometimes of the tiny kind. Epsilon, while not the fully cursive type, is usually made in two movements, and its top often slants prominently above the other letters. It regularly is ligatures to the letter following. The first two movements of alpha, which also is ligatured, may be either straight or rounded, and the peak often has a loop. There is some tendency toward spacing between words, for example in lines 6 and 10, where the speed increases near the ends of recipes as the scribe ligatures whole strings of letters in regular cursive fashion. In general, one is reminded of "chancery" type hands of the period. Faulty orthography occurs in l. 6. Initial trema is written twice, but there are no accents or stops.
