cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is regularly cut at the top, which preserves the upper margin. The left hand side is broken, yet the beginning of some lines is preserved. The right hand side is badly damaged; it is vertically damaged at the left hand side as a result of a fold. Generally the papyrus was broken into three pieces. Some fragments of at least two papyri have been wrongly patched on the Verso.
