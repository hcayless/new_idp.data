cu500_t | 1 | Rullius to [Iulius] Apollinarius, his brother, greeting. I marvel that you did not send us a letter to let us know whether you had come through safely, in accordance with our prayers, and how you are doing now, so that we might know how your affairs are going. Send the white cottons, as I requested of you when I was with you, to Menon. ‚Ç£If there are soft ones,‚Ç¥ he said when he was with you, ‚Ç£let them be sent from Rome.‚Ç¥ I will deliver them(?) if you wish to send them . . . .  I sent you a copy(?) so that it might not go astray . . . . ;(2nd hand) I wish you good health, brother, . . . .  Sitelkas(?) and his children salute you, each by name.
