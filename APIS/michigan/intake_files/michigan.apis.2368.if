Having a case against Chairemon, son of Petheus, from the village of Karanis, about property belonging to myself and to my sister Valeria Sarapias, who is a minor, which property he has encroached on and holds up to half an aroura in the plains of the said Karanis in the place called the ‚Ç£Hollow‚Ç¥, from which he takes no small profit for himself annually; and since the case concerning him requires the investigation of the most illustrious prefect, Sempronius Liberalis, I ask that a copy of this petition be transmitted to him through an assistant, so that, having received a written summons, he may be present wherever the assizes of the nome and judgment shall be held, since I am satisfied with the present statement.;The 18th year of Antoninus the lord, Phamenoth 7.;(2nd hand) I, . . ., have delivered it to him in person.
