cu500_pal | 1 | Regular and clear semicursive. A strip of papyrus had been pasted over the first line, in such a way, however, as to leave visible some few traces of letters of l. 1. However, they do not mention at all that the back of the papyrus has been enforced with several other strips. One of them runs horizontally at the top of the verso and the other one vertically on the right hand side. In the same area there are two or three more strips which are much smaller. I was able to see this, because two of the strips are now almost detached; they bear some kind of writing in Greek which interferes with the writing of the proper papyrus on the front. The writing on the strips is in some parts rather visible through the small holes on the recto of the main papyrus (T. Gagos to editors of re-edition of ll. 2-5).

cu500_t | 1 | " . . . to . . . whose mother is Aphrodisia, daughter of Ammonios, greeting.  [The arouras] which I  rent from the State in the area surrounding the village of Hephaistias out of the sequester possessions of the financial administration, formerly belonging to Herakleides, at the rent of 1 1/2 artabas in wheat, two arouras, and likewise about the same (total) 4 arouras. In accordance with this document I agree that we will do the work upon these in common, equally, each doing one half the work, for the period covered by my lease, all the farm work and seed falling upon us in common on a half share basis, on the understanding that we are to share the crop of the above mentioned four arouras in common, equally, by halves."
