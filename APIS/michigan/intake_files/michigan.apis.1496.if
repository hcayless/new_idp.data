cu500_t | 1 | Achillas to Thaisous and Achilleus his son, greeting. I want you to know that that woman who was defiled arrived here on the 15th of Epeiph along with her father. I accordingly informed Achillas, my assistant, and Primianus that they were here. She has already given her petition to the prefect, desiring to complete her case so that she may sail back up river. But up to the present time her petition has not come to attention. A sent word to her through Pammenes, the prefect&apos;s adjutant who is a friend of ours. Annis paid me a visit and the wife of Valens went home. Receive a copy of the petition wrapped up in the letter. . . Good health. Epeiph 22.";Verso: address

cu520 | 1 | Achillas writes presumably to his wife Thaisous and his son Achilleus. The main part of the letter concerns a "dishonored" woman. This woman was probably travelling to Alexandria for a hearing with the prefect of Egypt, but the interest of Achillas, the author of the letter, is far from clear. The verso contains very faded traces of the address.
