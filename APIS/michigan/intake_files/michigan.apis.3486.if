cu500_pal | 1 | The papyrus is written in a good cursive hand which becomes increasingly smaller toward the end of the document, but which seems to be that of the same scribe throughout. The list has been carefully checked, each entry having at the beginning a short, thick, diagonal stroke obviously added later by a different pen. In addition, some of the entries, especially in col. IX, have a second check placed over the numeral at the end of the line. In view of this fact and the circumstance that three entries have been bracketed (see note to l. 233), we conclude that for some reason the account was doubly audited for this day (the 12th). Final column contains only 8 entries and the remainder of the column (approximately 21 cm.) was left blank.
