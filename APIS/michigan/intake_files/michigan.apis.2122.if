cu590_con | 1 | This papyrus is broken off both at the top and at the bottom, where from the space remaining it cannot be determined whether we have the actual end of the document.Folded vertically three times, the papyrus was broken along the fold down the center, and subsequently repaired. Unfortunately, it was repaired incorrectly, for the two halves were misaligned. The right half should be raised one line in order to realign the text properly. Although much of the text appears to be lost and there is extensive damage along the folds, nevertheless the nature of the document is clear, and in several places the lost text can be restored with confidence.
