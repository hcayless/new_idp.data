cu500_t | 1 | Memorandum to Zenon from Artemidoros, the son of Theodoros. My father deposited with Pantheros two mills, which were being used, and we had been paying the rent of the room in which they had been set up to Pantheros and likewise to Semphthos who now bought the house. Now Pantheros and Semphthos have dismantled the mills and, though I wish to take them away, they refuse to give them up. Please therefore compel them to give them back; for because of my father being absent they have treated us with contempt.
