cu500_pal | 1 | The letter on the recto is c: chi, kappa, ypsilon, and epsilon often have an additional upper flourish, while omicron is usually smaller than the other lettersand raised. The hand resembles a number of texts written in what is often called a chancery style. This letter, in particular, &apos;. . . extends to the reader the courtesy of immediate legibility as well as beauty." The verso of the second panel from right contains an address in tall letters which slant to the left: to Claudius Agenor from Xenophon.

cu500_t | 1 | "Greetings, my lord, that you receive a letter from me through Harpokration, that excellent fellow, so that you may at the same time know that I am grateful to him for acting for you with utmost zeal in your absence in whatever I may ask of him. He did nothing alien to his feelings for you. The vineyards, as I wrote to you also at another time, my lord, receive both cultivation and irrigation, as much as is possible. I pray for your good health.";(Verso): "To Claudius Agenor from Xenophon."

cu590_con | 1 | The letter is well preserved and its entire text can be understood, in spite of several small lacunas along its folds. Three edges of the papyrus are intact; it is very likely, as well, that only one line of text is missing at the bottom edge. This is indicated by the position of the center horizontal fold and by the fact that the last preserved line of text contains the beginning of an expected epistolary closing. In addition to the horizontal fold, the papyrus has six vertical folds from left to right, hence fourteen panels of equal dimensions.
