Make every effort, Aphreingios, to send me a spathion of fish-sauce as well as anise, and then you will bring here without fail the medicaments for my child Heras. You have sent me word that Zenobia and her brother are coming; we have patiently waited for them on the river. I salute my daughter Mara together with her sister. I salute Demetria together with her children. I salute Ama . . . and Apa Ganeis together with their people. I salute the sister of Apynchis . . . salutes by name all those who love you. (2nd hd.)

cu520 | 1 | This letter from an unnamed writer to his mother is devoted for the most part to greetings sent to members of the family. These are interrupted only by an urgent request for provisions and medicaments and an expression of anxiety about an anticipated visit of the writer&apos;s sister. The verso contains the address (house of Apa Kyri in the amphodon of Hierakeion). The family is clearly Christian, and the author&apos;s use of the proskynema formula, a pagan one, shows that the writer was a new convert from paganism continuing old mental habits.
