What has Menas to say about the accusations ?";The soldier Flavius Menas said: "I did not murder anyone and I also prove it. What if Menas proves(?) it? The same presbyter feeling nauseous stayed in the church and I in Antaiou (polis) and an abscess came out of the throat of the presbyter and he died thereof.

Being asked why they murdered my husband they said: &apos;The most illustrious Sarapammon and Menas wrote us to kill him&apos;, and I reserve against them the law me suiting regarding the death of my wretched husband. When Herakleios, my wretched husband, had been killed and his remains had been given to the fire so that they may be burned they poured again water on the same remains and they threw his bones in a basket and burried them I do not know where. I ask, therefore, that they are given to me so that I can burry them.
