cu500_pal | 1 | For a general description of the palaeography, see electronic version of 21 a-m. A paragraphos occurs between ll. 5-6 to separate two recipes. Beneath the four lines of text in ll. 6-9 is a blank space of one line, followed by three more lines of text, so badly rubbed by some abrasive material that only tiny dots of ink remain here and there. These lines could in fact have been deliberately erased.

cu520 | 1 | The first part written by the scribe (ll. 1-5) contains the uses of a foregoing recipe, which were continued at the top of the following page. They are reminiscent of those given for the phoinikine-plaster of Galen (XIII 380; Aet. XV, p. 45; 21F 10 ff.). The second hand added in the lower margins (ll. 6-9) a recipe for the plaster with zinc oxide.
