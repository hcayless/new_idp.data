cu500_pal | 1 | Upper margin of 4 cm. The hand writing is a large and heavy &apos;Biblical Uncial&apos;. The roundels in which the upper bow and cross-bar of epsilon terminate, as well as the heaviness of the of the writing, point towards assigning the hand to the latter part of the third or even to the fourth century A.D. The hand is a somewhat slovenly example of its type: the upper curve of sigma, and the form of alpha are hesitantly made. There is one high stop (ii 11) followed by a paragrahos; and the scribe once adds an accent (i, 4-5).;In a cursive hand above col. i has been written the figure &apos;61&apos;, above col. ii &apos;62&apos;. Between cols. i and ii 193 letters (following the OCT) are missing, that is between 16 to 18 lines (the maximum number of letters per line is 14 in col. i, 13 in col. ii; minimum 9 and 11). The lines begin further to the left at the foot of the column and are therefore probably longer there. The columns will have originally contained between 27 and 29 lines. If the roll began at Hellenica Book VII, column 60 would be expected to fall somewhere near where col. i begins. The text is unremarkable but admitted hiatus.
