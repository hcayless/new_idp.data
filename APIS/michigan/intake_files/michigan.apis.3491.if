cu500_pal | 1 | In l. 4 the writer of the codex placed a large dot after pyxxide to mark the end of the recipe. In addition he placed a broken line beneath l. 4, which he extruded into the margin. Then, after leaving a blank space of one line, he indented the two following lines by 4 letter-spaces to mark them off as a general title for the next section. On the edge of the papyrus opposite l. 7 is a very black curved stroke, not an antisigma, in the second hand. It was undoubtedly intended to draw attention to the first recipe in the new section. For a general introduction to the palaeography of this codex, see electronic version of P. Mich. inv. 21.
