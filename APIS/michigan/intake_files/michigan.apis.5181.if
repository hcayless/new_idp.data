cu500_pal | 1 | Text on recto is partially rubbed; written along the fibers in small sized cursive with ligatures. From the preserved text it seems that the hand is practiced. No diacritical marks are attested. Text on verso is written in different hand; the scribe, who is practiced, rotated the papyrus 90 degrees to write along the fibers. The letters are large cursive and ligatured. Some letters are bolder than the others as a result of dipping the pen into the ink. The scribe ends lines by extending the final letter with horizontal stroke.
