cu500_t | 1 | Artemis to Sokrates, greeting. Before all else I pray for your health. I arrived in the city on the 9th. I ask you, if you can, send me one of your group, since I need him to be my legal representative, for a woman is not permitted to engage in a lawsuit without a legal representative. Know that if you help me the affair will have a successful issue. In order that he may come quickly, know that if I suffer injury you are also going to be hurt, but if we win you will have the profit. We salute your mother Thatres, Achillas, Sarapion, Ptolemaios, Kastor, and Tasoucharion.  I pray for your health.;;(Verso) Deliver to . . . from Harpakysis . . . .
