cu510 | 2 | Youtie LC, ZPE 33, 215-6, 1979, Pl XIb -- SB XVI 12568 -- The reading "Argeou" is problematic. There is a vertical after "dos", then "alpha", "rho", followed by a letter that it looks like better an "epsilon" than "gamma". Then "tou" is certain followed by the reading of the edition "uiou mou Fas;ganiou".  (NL)
