cu520 | 1 | This side contains an account prepared by the supervisor of an oil-press, perhaps as part of the routine business of an estate. He acknowledges receipt of safflower, doubtless in the form of seed, to be converted to oil in conformity with a standard conversion rate, 9 artabas = 1 metretes. He then specifies the quantities of oil returned in five shipments by donkey-convoy.

cu590_con | 1 | This medium brown papyrus is broken off at the bottom. Perhaps as much as one-half of the column has been lost at the bottom. The major difficulty of transcription arises from the severe abrasion of the ink along the left side of the column. This small piece of papyrus was cut from the roll at some later time in order to accommodate a short account which was placed on this side.
