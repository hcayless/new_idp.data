cu500_pal | 1 | The sub-Achmimic influence on the shape of certain letters, the date may be rather early. The hand is similar to rude hands often found in magical texts, but much more neat. The pen was stiff, and rather fine for the size of letters.

cu590_con | 1 | Two sheets of a good papyrus with writing on one side only. The first two lines seem to be complete, but the remaining sixteen have lost from a fourth to a third of their length by the breaking off of the papyrus on the right-hand side of the page. Another break, further to the left, was mended in ancient times, and the text was patched up after a fashion.
