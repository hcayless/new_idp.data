cu520 | 1 | The text consists of two sections, one of three lines (1-3), the other of two (4-5). Since the sections were written parallel to each other but in opposite directions, and all the lines were subseuqently damaged when a substantial portion of the ostracon broke off, only the beginnings of lines remain in one section (1-3) and only the ends in the other (4-5), Aion reported the death of his wife and another member of his family, probably a son or a daughter.
