cu300 | 1 | 1 papyrus ; 10 x 13 cm
cu500 | 1 | The papyrus was excavated in Karanis during the first expedition of the Univesity of Michigan in 1924 in area G, which was heavily disturbed by the local farmers. It was found in the same structure (5006) that produced a large number of the papyri that once belonged to Gaius Apolinarius Niger and his family. However, this letter does not seem to be connected with this family. According to the records at the Univesity of Michigan, at some stage, the upper part of inv. 2995 was in the same folder with various fragments under no. 2984 that came also from the same structure, and was later transferred to its current location. Further on area G and the excavations at karanis, see P. van Minnen, ZPE 100, 1994, 227-229

cu500_t | 1 | Didumos to his most honored Hatres, very many greetings. You wrote: "I told you to let the house. You haven&apos;t let it". Being troubled because of the liability, I withdrew. Pan[.]maules lifted off the outer bar of the door of the courtyard and threshing floor and carried off whatever was in the house. Today the door is open. Antinos, son of Heraiskos, has secured the house and is remaining there. So make every effort to (finalise the matter?) of the house or the courtyard because I am writing to you today my third letter about this. All my people greet you by name...;To Hatres, wine dealer, (son of?) Hori(on?)

cu518 | 1 | Karanis, Herakleidou meris, Arsinoite nome, province of Egypt
cu520 | 1 | Didymos writes to Hatres, rather brusquely since this is his third letter on the topic, about letting a house and attached courtyard.  Because of a difficulty with some sort of liability, presumably connected with the property, he himself has withdrawn. Because the house is now unoccupied, all movables have been removed.
