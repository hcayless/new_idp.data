cu500_t | 1 | (Recto);;Apollonios to Zenon greeting. You wrote to us that Pais the brewer says that he has agreed with us for eleven artabs a day. He has therefore lied to you; for he undertook to brew twelve artabai and it was on that understanding that I have sent him to you. Detain him then until we arrive, and order your agent to check the accounts of the beer-shop and follow all the operations of the brewery. Farewell. Year 31, Dystros [7], Phamenoth 14.;;(Verso);;To Zenon.
