cu500_pal | 1 | The hand of the body of the contract is medium-sized and semi-cursive, with letters 3 mm. high. The writing is in the main flourished and quite expensive, and the scribe has a fondness for long, decorative horizontal strokes. There is often crowding toward the right edge of the papyrus, thus indicating that this edge was the original limit of the piece. The hypograph (2nd hd.) is written in a smaller hand, with letters 2 mm. in height, regularly spaced, and rather square. The left margin is lost, while at the right, the writing runs almost to the edge of the papyrus. Line 1 is certainly the first line of the document, although the upper margin is lost. At the bottom, the blank space varies from 6.8 cm. to 7.4 cm., since the last line of the text (the hypograph, line 17) slants upward. Interlineation averages 3 mm., and approximately 1 cm. separates the body of the agreement from the hypograph.

cu500_t | 1 | "NN . . . from the village of Alabastrine of the Hermopolite nome, priest of the first-rank temples of Apollo and Isis, to NN, eques and signifier of the turma of Heraclides of the Ala Mauretana, greetings.;I acknowledge that I have received from you as a loan in cash the full sum of 116 drachmas in imperial silver coinage, at interest of 1 drachma per mina a month, which I bind myself to repay to you within 4 months from Epeiph of the current thirteenth year without delay. If I do not make repayment, when the time for repayment begins, I agree to be laible to seizure until such time as I repay both the principal with a 50% surcharge and the simple interest, and interest at the same rate for the period beyond the term of the loan. You have the right of execution against both me and all my property, as if there were a judgement. Let this chirograph, written in one copy and subscribed by me, be valid, as if registered in the public archives. The thirteenth year of the Imperatores Caesares Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Arabicus Adiabenicus Parthicus Maximus and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Augusti, Epeiph.;(2nd hd.) I, NN, acknowledge that I have received 116 drachmas in full, as stated above."

cu590_con | 1 | This light-brown and very smooth papyrus was folded three times vertically and probably four times horizontally. Two of the horizontal fold panels (= 4 cm.) are lost on the left from lines 3-11, and three panels (= 6 cm.) are lost from lines 1-2 and 12-17. But, except in lines 1, 3, and 17, where the names of the borrowerand the lender will have stood, the text is easily restorable from known examples of loan agreements of the same period.
