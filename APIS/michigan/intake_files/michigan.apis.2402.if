cu500_t | 1 |     [To his excellency Tiberius(?)] Claudius Xenophon, epistrategos, [from Iulia] Herais, Antinoite, through [her son, Gaius Iulius] Priscus. Of the petition which I submitted to [Titus Pactumeius] Magnus, the [former] prefect, and [of the sacred] subscription [which I obtained from him, . . .] a copy is below. [I request, if] it seems good to your fortune, that you hear [my complaint against] Herakleides on account of his unjust [demands] for payment of a tax by me [. . .] not through the [. . .] but using the [power] accrueing to him to commit outrages [. . .] and to exact money illegally. It is as follows:;    [To Titus Pactumeius] Magnus, prefect of Egypt, [from Iulia] Herais, Antinoite, [and however I am styled.] I am submitting to you, my [lord] prefect, [a case] which requires your adjudication. [Since] Herakleides, son of Ammonios, farmer of the tax on catoecic registry for the Arsinoite and other nomes, possessing a brutal character, has intimidated me, wishing to demand payment unjustly of a tax which I do not owe on unproductive royal land, the tax never having been paid on land of such a kind, I have necessarily fled to you, the savior, and I request that you order that a letter be written to the epistrategos of the Seven Nomes to hear my complaint against him, so that nothing violent may happen to me at the instigation of Herakleides and I may receive this benefaction from you.;     Copy of the subscription (of prefect): Year 19, Mesore 3. Petition his excellency the epistrategos.;       The copy was made on Thoth 24 of year 20.;      (2nd hand) I, Iulia Herais, through my son [Iulius] Priscus, have submitted this petition. . . .
