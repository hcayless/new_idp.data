cu500_pal | 1 | Small letters with many abbreviations and ligatures. the bottom margin is preserved and is c. 7,3 cm. On the verso there are traces of ink. These traces preserve 12 lines as the present side and the same bottom margin. Perhaps they are not another document, but the ink of one folded part that was left on the surface of the verso. But the reading at this point is very difficult.
