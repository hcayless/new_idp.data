cu500_pal | 1 | The application is written in a small and somewhat casual hand in an upward direction; the 2nd and 3rd hands are similar but somewhat larger. (TC) The papyrus has already been used before; traces of a former washed out text are still visible. Abbreviation is by raising the last letter written.

cu520 | 1 | The text is an instruction to pay Papo(), the manager of the epoikion of Heraklas, his salary for the month of Epeiph. His monthly salary is 24 drachmas, but he is paid only 12 drachmas because he is still in debt to the Theones, and his salary is reduced by half to discharge his debt.
