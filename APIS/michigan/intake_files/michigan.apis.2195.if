cu500 | 1 | P.Mich. inv. 4385, fragment a, is part of a roll patched together to write the record of the daily receipts of the grapheion of Karanis. Fragments b-d (numbered according to the verso) offer on the recto a totally different text (P.Congr. XV 15), which was glued to the left of fragment a; a few letters of it were mistaken by H.A. Sanders as a correction, numbered as line 13 (= P.Congr. XV 15, line 97).;The left part of what was given as fragment d in P.Mich. VII (fragment from inv. 4390) joins inv. 4385, fragment a, to the left, giving the beginnings of 7 lines of a second column. This proves also that the lines of fragment a were complete on the right side, and that there was a shorter line between lines 10 and 11 of the edition, as already suggested by R. Merkelbach. The place of the right part of "fragment d" is uncertain. (PH);The date in the upper margin was certainly written after the Latin text.
