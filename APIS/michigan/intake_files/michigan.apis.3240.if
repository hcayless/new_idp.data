cu500_pal | 1 | Written in a flowing cursive characteristic of mid-first-century hand and the entire letter conveys a neat impression. Free margins at the top (2 cm.), left (1 cm.), and bottom (2.5 cm.). At the right, however, the writing continues to the edge of the papyrus.

cu500_t | 1 | "Nilos to Nemesion his brother, greetings. I was exceedingly joyful upon hearing that you were freed. Know that the woman, the one in Kallonios&apos; house, has arrived at Karanis and I have been asked by friends. Therefore I write to you so that you may keep an eye on her. You will make her not subject to extortion. Accordingly, do not do otherwise. Good health. 12th year, Sebastos 5."

cu520 | 1 | The content of this letter from Nilos to his brother Nemesion is somewhat unclear. First Nilos expresses his joy upon hearing that his brother had been released. The circumstances of this alone are unclear. Nilos also asks the brother to monitor a woman living in the house of a certain Kallinikos. It is not clear why he is supposed to; the text might imply that this action of Nemesion might free the woman from extortion; again the circumstances are very unclear. The verso contains the address.

cu590_con | 1 | This light-brown papyrus is regularly cut off at the top and at the left; at the right and at the bottom the edges are slightly more irregular, suggesting that it was torn off gently. The sheet has only sustained significant damage to the right, though this is nowhere significant enough to impede a complete transcription of the text.
