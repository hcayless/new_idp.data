cu520 | 1 | The recto contains parts of Galatians 5.11-15, and the verso parts of 5.22-6.1. Comparison with the Sahidic and Bohairic versions shows deviations from both, but in general what remains resembles the Sahidic more often than it does the Bohairic.

cu590_con | 1 | This piece consists of two contiguous fragments. Recto and verso each preserve a narrow strip of writing (5-9 letters) which is eleven letters in length, with traces of a twelfth. The papyrus seems to show the upper margin (0.8 cm.) on the verso; but the corresponding part of the recto is occupied with writing, and the original margin may now be lost. On the other three ;sides, the sheet is broken off.;On the basis of the reconstruction, the number of letters on the recto varies from 20-29 per line, a nd on the verso, where the writing is more compressed, the range is from 29-36. If we posit an average line of 27 letters and assume that the amount of lost material from the end of R 12 to the beginning of V1 was approximately the same as that in Sahidic, then ca. 17-18 lines have been lost in this text. Since lines 1-12 on recto and verso are approximately 8.5 cm. in height, the missing lines would have occupied about 12.5 cm., and the original sheet, minus margins, would come to ca. 21 cm. Similarly, the original length of each line can be computed to be about 12 cm. To judge from its dimensions, the codex is most likely to have had a single column of writing per page. Its original format was probably similar to, though rather larger than, the Berlin codex of I Clement, which measures - excluding margins - 8 x 18 cm.; with its margins it extends to 12 x 25 cm., cf. Schmidt, Clemensbrief, 7f.).
