There are no punctuations, breathings, accents and other diacritical marks. Iota adscript is written only with omega, omitted with alpha or eta.

cu520 | 1 | The papyrus contains a prose summary of the seventh and eigth books of the Iliad which is unlike extant Homer-hypotheses in manuscripts or on papyri in two respects. First, it quotes not only the first line of each book, as papyrus hypotheses do regularly, but also the last line. Second, the hypothesis omits all mention of gods. Deities play a minor role in these books, so it is conceivable that the hypothesizer could have left them out here, because of their lack of importance to the narrative, but still have included them in his hypotheses of e.g. A, E, and Y. The second of the two manuscript hypotheses to H and TH omits the gods in H but mentions their more prominent role in TH.
