cu500_pal | 1 | The hand is large, rapid, sprawling - in short, skilled but almost ugly. The writer experienced considerable difficulty in maintaining a straight line. Nevertheless, his script is always legible. The complimentary close in line 13 and the postscript in the left margin, now almost totally illegible as a result of abrasion, are from another hand. The letter through line 13 was written across the fibers, but the marginal addition of course runs with the fibers.
