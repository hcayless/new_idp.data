cu520 | 1 | Loan by Soeris, Ploutarche&apos;s mother, to Achilleus her son in law, in acc. with contract notarized by the public registry of Oxyrhynchos in Phar. (3/27-4/25/49); the money originates from Thermouthion selling her deceased father&apos;s share of a house in the Laura Hippodromou to Didymos, son of Didymos (the sale was made with her husband Dioskous as kyrios). The loan is probably equivalent to loans from wives to husbands.
