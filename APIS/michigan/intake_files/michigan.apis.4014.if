cu500_pal | 1 | The hand, while not a rapid one, displays some ligatures. it clearly belongs to someone with experience but is somewhat uneven in the height of the letters. It resembles some features of text number 40 in R. Seider, PalÈñographie der griechischen papyri Band I erster Teil (Stuttgart 1967) of the early third century.

cu520 | 1 | The first line informs us that the subject is the livelihood of orphans, who may have had some of their property seized from them. If this were a petition or official document, we would expect an address to an official and a very large amount of text lost to the left. More likely, perhaps, is a private letter voicing such concerns.

cu590_con | 1 | the type of text on this papyrus is difficult to establish. We have only the upper and right-hand margins. From the appearance a considerable amount of the text is lost to the left. Damage from line 4 onward leaves the sense even more fragmentary until line 7 where the papyrus breaks off. being blank, the back offers no help.
