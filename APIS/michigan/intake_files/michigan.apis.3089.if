If anyone fails to meet his obligations in these or the other matters, the president has the right to exact pledges. If anyone misconducts himself, let him be fined whatever the society may decide. If anyone receives notice of a meeting and does not attend, let him be fined one drachme in the village, but in the city four drachmai. If anyone marries let him pay two drachmai, for the birth of a male child two drachmai, for a female one drachma, for the purchase of a property four drachmai, for a flock of sheep four drachmai, for cattle one drachme. If anyone neglects another in trouble and does not give aid to release him from his trouble, let him pay eight drachmai. And each one who in taking seats at the banquets shoves in front of another shall pay an extra three obols for his own place. If anyone prosecutes another or defames him, let him be fined eight drachmai. If anyone intrigues against another or corrupts his home, let him be fined eight drachmai. If anyone is given into custody for a private debt, let them go bail for him up to one hundred silver drachmai for thirty days, within which he will release the men. May health prevail! [But] if one the members dies, let all be shaved and let them hold a feast for one day, each bringing at once one drachme and two loaves, and in the case of other bereavements, let them hold a feast for one day. Let him who is not shaven in case of a death be fined four drachmai. Whoever has taken no part in the funeral and has not placed a wreath on the tomb shall be fined four drachmai.
