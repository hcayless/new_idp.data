cu500_t | 1 | (Recto);;[- - -] to Zenon greeting. You wrote to me about the two cows  and [the calf, bidding me hand them over to - - -]. But the peasants object, saying that they have bought them from [- - -] through whom the money has been given, lest we should be thouthgt to have acted high-handedly [- - -] we have sent Nechthminis and Tetoramous(?) [- - - in order that] those who were tried about this very matter [should be confronted] with them before you. Please [therefore examine them and] write to me to say whom the cattle are to be delivered to; for [we are keeping] the cows and the calf [until you write] about them. For indeed the people of the village bear witness [that the man had gone off] to the Isieion and that his wife had sold the cattle in [his] absence. Farewell.;;(Verso);;To Zenon.
