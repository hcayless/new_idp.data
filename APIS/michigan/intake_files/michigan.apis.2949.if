cu500_t | 1 | I, Kronion, son of Herodes, acknowledge that I have sold to Didymos, son of Didymos, in accordance with this contract from the present day forever the sacred land that belongs to me near Ptolemais Melissourgon, from that which is under cultivation, five arourai or as many as there may be in one parcel; the neighbors being on the south the uncultivated land, on the north the land that formerly belonged to Petermouthis but which now belongs to Herakles, on the west crown land and in part the uncultivated land tat has been purchased, on the east crown land. And I have received the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee from all public debts and all additional taxes and every impost of former times up to the past fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus and of the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus as well as from all private debts and every claim forever, together with the rent of the present sixteenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, the lease for this same year remaining valid for the tenant. And my wife, who lives with me legally, Thermouthis, daughter of Alkimos, consents to the sale and agrees not to proceed against it forever and not to bring any claim and that no one else shall do so in her behalf as aforesaid. I, Kronion, wrote for my wife since she is illiterate, and I am her appointed guardian.
