I pray that you may be in good health, my dear friends. [In the 4th year] of the Imperator Caesar Marcus Antonius Gordian Pius Felix Augustus, Epeiph 25.;    [To Aurelius] Ammonios also known as Apollonios, strategos of the Oxyrhynchite, [from Aurelius] Theon, son of Diogenes, his mother being Soeris, from the city of Oxyrhynchus. The following is a copy of the petition which I submitted to the most eminent ex-prefect, Lucretius Annianus, [extracts] of the imperial ordinances having been inserted therein, and of the decision which I received from him:;        To [Lucretius] Annianus, most illustrious prefect, from Aurelius Theon, son of Diogenes, his mother being Soeris, from the city [of Oxyrhynchus]. The imperial ordinances are clear, most illustrious prefect, and plainly [it is ordained] that one who has become father of five children, be released from the burden of liturgical offices, as he himself undertakes such a [burdening] public service as raising so many [children] with his care and expenses. I myself, although being of small means as to my resources, have not shrunk from the rearing of [my children] who now also have become known through public documents. I ask that the orders issued by the [imperial edicts] be safeguarded also for me. Therefore, I present the petitions in order that, my lord, in accordance with [your - - -] reverence for the laws you, by (your) subscription, direct the strategos of the nome, [- - -] lawlessness, that is, that I may not be burdened by any [liturgy] in accordance with the orders issued in the case of many others, so that I may be relieved. Farewell. I, [Aurelius Theon, sent] (the petition) for submission. I, Aurelius Chairemon, wrote for him since he is illiterate.;        [The - - - day before] the Kalends of June, in the consulship of our lord Gordian Augustus and Aviola. [The strategos] will see to it that everything is done in accordance with the orders issued regarding such matters.  volume [ ], sheet 265(?).;    [This completes the petition] and the subscription. I have thus appended the names of my children, which also appear in the [registers of the public] records, and I request that you send (copy of this) to the [village secretary] of Mermertha where I have performed my public duties, [in order that he may know] I am not under the obligation of public duties, but also to the keepers of the property registers, (so that) they [make] the appropriate registration. The list is: Pausanias, Apollonios, Aniketos, Agathos Daimon, [- - -. Year . .] of the Imperator Caesar Marcus Antonius Gordian Pius Felix Augustus, [- - -. I, Aurelius Theon, have submitted (this petition)]. I, Aurelius Herakles, son of Heraklammon, wrote for him since he is illiterate.;[I, Aurelius - - -, assistant, have conveyed it.] Year 4, Epeiph 26.

(l. 25-26). The last line (l. 33) probably certified that the privilege was duly recorded in the property registers on July 20, 241 A.D.
