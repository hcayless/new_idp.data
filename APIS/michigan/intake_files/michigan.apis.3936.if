cu500_pal | 1 | The handwriting is neat, with almost complete absence of cursive features. Parallel examples are P.Mert. II 93, dated in the fourth century A.D; P.MÈ­nch. III 99, dated in A.D. 390. The scribe always abbreviates ‚Ç£oinou knidia‚Ç¥ as oin/ kn/ and the iota is made larger projecting both above and below the line with loops at its finals. In line 5 the blank space between these two words is 0.8 cm, leaving the impression that the scribe wanted to write the abbreviation kn and the following digit just below the same details of the line 4. This practice, actually, works well in line 6 without any need to leave blank spaces again. Below the figures in lines 2 and 6 in the right column the scribe drew a stroke (c. 1.5 cm in length) and below ‚Ç£omou‚Ç¥ in ll. 2, 5 and 6 L-shaped paragraphi.

cu518 | 1 | Hermopolite nome, province of Egypt (?)
cu520 | 1 | The front side of P.Corn. inv. II 38 (= SB VIII 9907) is an offer made by a farmer to Aurelios Taurinos, son of Akylaos, councilman of Hermou polis, to lease an orchard belonged to his epoikion, situated somewhere around Timonthis of the Hermopolite nome. The document is dated in September 19, A.D. 388. The time of the lease is three years, which means that by the end of this term, about September of A.D. 391, the document was not needed to be kept further more. Therefore, the other (and blank at that time) side of papyrus was reused by someone for writing down accounts upside down in relation to the text on the front. N. Lewis in his edition of the front side made no reference to this document of the back side.;The accounts are private and provide information on expenses expressed in quantities of knidia of wine. The purpose of these expenses is not stated, but it could be either in the procedure of private affairs (cf. e.g. P.Ant. I 42, 23-24; BGU XII 2178, with the parallels mentioned there) or of annona (cf. e.g. the receipts in F. Mitthof, Annona militaris, Firenze 2001, no 156, also pp. 254-257). The interest lies on the noun mer‚é¼dew (probably in the Hermopolite nome), mentioned in lines 2, 3, 5 and 6, and their two unattested names, on one more (rare) instance of the tax dipl(a) (l. 4) in the Byzantine period, on the calculation of naulon as a 5% of the total load, on two very rare attested nouns in lines 20-21, and on a city, in lines 8, 11, 14, 15 and 18 (probably Hermou polis). The service of a settlement guard (l. 21) points to an epoikion and, because of the large amounts transported, it could be only an assumption that the person involved in these transactions is the owner of the epoikion, Aurelios Taurinos or one of his steward. Considering this possible connection of the front and back side and the use of some rare words, the following remark does not imply anything, and therefore, it should be also considered just as it is said, a remark without further comments, and nothing else: In the document of the front side we find (as in the present document on the back) rare or addenda lexicis words (see N. Lewis&apos; notes on ll. 15, 18-19, 19, 23 (twice!) and 24); on the contrary, a few days later than this lease was written, another person from Timonthis made a leasing agreement with a beneficiarius (P.Lips. I 22 = M.Chrest. 277) without "unusual" details in the phraseology.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is now mutilated at its top right side, at a point where is almost no writing. There is a manufacture&apos;s kollesis of c. 3 cm in breadth: considering the front side (where the join is clearly seen) the right piece was pasted on top of the left one. It seems that, when the scribe wrote the text on the front side, took into consideration the peculiarly cut right hand side (see plate I of ed. princ.), and the lease seems to be complete. The papyrus might had been folded in the middle once vertically and once horizontally, as the preserved foldings can show. In that case, since the upper half is 13 cm and the bottom preserved half is 10.5, from the latter a piece of c. 2.5 cm at the bottom is lost. This assumption is supported by the fact that the fibers of the bottom edge are somewhat frayed, pointing that the papyrus was not regularly cut there, as it happens in the other sides. Therefore, although there are practically no top and right margins, we have to assume that the bottom margin was c. 3 cm. In that case the total lost lines of the back side seem to be small. Line 5 calculates the total amount of the previous two lines, 3 and 4. Line 2 is also a total amount, probably of other two lost lines. Moreover, we should take into account a possible head title (e.g. logos analwmatos; cf. line 7) making a total lost of three lines at the top, therefore c. 1.5 cm writing surface plus c. 1 cm top margin.
