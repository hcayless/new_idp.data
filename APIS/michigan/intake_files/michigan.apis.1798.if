cu500_t | 1 | Menorandum to Zenon. Concerning the gardeners, order Ptolemaios to find out from the accounts what they owe us from the 33rd year, or what they owe Panos, in order that they make a contract with us and remaining with us without fail may finish the works. Seeing that it is necessary for you to spend money finishing the works in the orchard, take guarantees from these people. When the orchard is worked over, I will also prune it. Petimouthes and his sons will work the part assigned to them, and I will give him anything extra that he may need. Concerning Menandros and Agathon, the following will work at the trees and water-channels, Stotoetis, Nechthosiris, and Diodoros; for these we will set aside a sum from which payments will have to be made to them. Onnophris will do the olive-grove in the orchard.
