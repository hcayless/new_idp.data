cu500_t | 1 | My lord son [Dorotheos] from your mother Aria, greetings. Before all else, I pray  to the Divine Providence that is with God that you may be in good health and prosperous when my letter is given to you. I want you to know that of the 1000 myriads I received nothing from [--]nianus except the 500 myriads in Alexandria. And with reference to what you said about getting the two hundred myriads from the apprentice of Ameinias, I did not find him. And about the 500 myriads, will you please get them and send them? You know where I got them. I went to the bleacher for the three and a half lbs. And as you said, "Go to my sister Maria, and she gives them to you," I went and she gave me nothing. For what does go right for me? Know this too, that the orphan child is in my house, and I myself have need of expenses. And about the two and a half lbs., 2 1/2, I owe nothing except the pay for the bleacher. And if I do owe anything, I pay with these goods of mine. For in fact I have sold some of the same linen stuff at 10 myriads for 1 lb. I marvel at how you have neglected me. I salute you all, each by name. [--]es and our own people, each by name, salute you.;;(Verso);;Deliver to Dorotheos, son of Philippos, from Aria, his mother.
