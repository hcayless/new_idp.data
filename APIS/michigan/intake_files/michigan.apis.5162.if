cu520 | 1 | N»Ìjid reminds √¨Abd All»Ìh about an order of the amir which he had already informed him about urging him to take care of it himself, supervise it closely and appoint someone over it whom he trusts. N»Ìjid further seems to suggest that some inhabitants of √¨Abd All»ÌhÇ«÷s district have raised a complaint against him which might be related to the remark that √¨Abd All»ÌhÇ«÷s work is being examined. This letter might in fact be related to the complaint raised by some villagers mentioned in letter 6. The address and some information concerning the contents of the letter appear on Verso of the smallest fragment. ;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).

cu590_con | 1 | Dark brown papyrus consisting of two fragments, only one of which is depicted on the photo. Written with a thin pen in black ink which has disappeared in many places, perpendicular to the fibers on Recto, parallel to the fibers on Verso. The original cutting lines have partially been preserved at the bottom and right sides. The top and left sides are broken off. The upper right corner of the second fragment is lost without any loss of letters. Some fibers have disappeared causing a loss of one to two letters in several lines. There are many smaller holes leading to a considerable loss of text.
