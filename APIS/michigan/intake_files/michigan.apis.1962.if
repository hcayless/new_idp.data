cu500_pal | 1 | Upper and lower margins are lost, and only five of the sixteen lines are perfect. The lines whose length can be determined contain from 16 to 20 letters. The writing is a neat but not very regular book-hand, whichmay be assigned to the latter half of the second century A.D. A noteworthy feature is the breadth of the letters. In the case of the round letters epsilon, theta, omikron, sigma, it so perceptibly exceeds the height as to give them a flattened appearance. Ypsilon appears twice in a V shape, three times in the Y shape, with the stem turned slightly to the right. The spelling is correct. Iota adscript is admitted in l. 10 (eokei). There are no accents or other reading signs, and no marks of punctuation.
