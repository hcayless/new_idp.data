cu590_con | 1 | This light-brown papyrus is badly mutilated and the ink is abraded. Texts on fragment a (nos. 1-3) are still joined to one another, the first overlapping the second and the second the third. Blank fragment very loosely attached to the back of this papyrus. There is no reason to believe, however, that the smaller, blank fragment was glued on in antiquity to repair the main fragment. Possibly this small blank fragment got stuck to fragment because they were stored together. The small, blank fragmentIt has therefore been detached and scanned along with fragment b (TC).
