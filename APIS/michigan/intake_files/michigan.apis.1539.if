cu520 | 1 | Receipt issued to Kosmas (son of) John for the payment of poll tax (laographia). This papyrus, along with P. Mich. inv. 1840, is unusual in that it combines Coptic and Greek. The text begins with the name of the tax and the identification of the taxpayer in Coptic. Then follows in Greek the indiction year for which the tax is payed (the year preceding the date). The amount of the tax is then recorded in Coptic, with the resum»® and date following in Greek. Another unusual, though not unparalleled, feature is the fact that this receipt lacks a verb denoting the actual payment or reception of the tax.
