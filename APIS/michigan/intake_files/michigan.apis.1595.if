cu500_t | 1 | ". . .to Isidoros, his brother, greetings. As soon as I reached Antinoopolis, I received your letter, through which I get the feeling of seeing you. I therefore beseech you to do the same constantly, for in this way our love will be increased. Whenever I am slow to write to you, this happens easily because I find no one going your way. If you have need of anything, send me word since you know that I will do it without delay. If you write me a letter, send it to my friend Hermes at the house of Artemas so that he may deliver it to me. Hermes himself and his sister Tausiris greet you heartily. Farewell.";(Verso): "Deliver to my dear Isidoros in Philadelphia from . . . "
