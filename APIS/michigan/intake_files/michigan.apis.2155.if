cu520 | 1 | This text constitutes an agricultural account over expenses incurred in the early months of an unknown year in the course of farming operations. The land in question may have been devoted to a vineyard, a reed-bed, and a vegetable garden. The phrasing of the tripartite total recorded in line 13 shows that the account was compiled by the manager of a private estate for submission to the owner. Expenses in terms of money were itemized at the right side of the text line by line, but these figures have been stripped away. Their total, however, is presented in the last line of the column.
