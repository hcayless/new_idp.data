After this I report to your fatherhood concerning the matter of this man who will give you my letter, that he is a brother of mine and a mishap has befallen his knee which he does not yet understand. Now, for God&apos;s sake do this on my account with God (i.e. with God&apos;s help). Give him some good medicine in the name of my lord the holy Apa Kyrios. And give it to him with all your heart and give your attention to him until I come up to nourish him and if he still wants to go away, give the medicine to him being satisfied and let him cure himself because he doesn&apos;t . . . the matter. I do obeisance to your fatherhood."
