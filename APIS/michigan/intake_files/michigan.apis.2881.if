cu500_t | 1 | About 26 years old, with a scar on the left side of his neck and the left forearm. His wife Tanouris, daughter of Heronas. Against Bentetis, son of Bentetis, from Thouonis, son of Akousilaos, of Areos kome, the 26th of the present month Neos Sebastos of the 8th year of Tiberius.;(2nd hand) To Apollonios, strategos of the Arsinoite nome, from Thouonis, son of Akousilaos, of Areos kome of the division of Polemon, the 26th of the present month Neos Sebastos of the 8th year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator. While I was having a reckoning with Bentetis, son of Bentetis, a herdsman of Oxyrhyncha in the same division, regarding pay and allowances which he owes me, he then, not wishing to pay me but to cheat me, acted insultingly to me and to my wife Tanouris, daughter of Heronas, in the aforesaid Areos kome. And besides this he also mercilessly inflicted on my wife Tanouris many blows on whatever parts of her body he could, although she was pregnant, with the result that she gave birth to a dead child and she herself is confined to bed and is in danger of her life. Therefore I ask you to write to the elders of Oxyrhyncha to send the accused to you for the coming assizes. Farewell.;The eighth year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, the 27th of the month Neos Sebastos.;Thouonis, about 26 years old, with a scar on the left side of his neck and on his left forearm.
