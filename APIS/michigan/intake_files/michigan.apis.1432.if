cu500_pal | 1 | Written in an elegant and upright cursive with parallels among other documents from the Augustan period (cp. P. Mert. 1.8 = R. Seider, Palaeographie 1, no. 21, and P. Med. inv. 68.41 = SB 12.11016, photo in O. Montevecchi, La Papirologia, tav. 35). Because of numerous corrections and interlinear additions, perhaps in a second hand, inv. 1436 might have been thought to be the first draft and inv. 1440 a subsequent copy. At the same time, the writer&apos;s last thoughts on lines 6, 8 and 9 in inv. 1436, recorded interlinearly (lines 6a and 8a) or cancelled (line 9), are not incorporated at these same points in the text of inv. 1440.

Since this is illegal, I beg you, the benefactor of all, if it seems good, to assign that an order be written to Tryphon not to dun me about these matters, because I am not from the nome, but to turn over to me the cheirographia referred to, so that I may be benefitted. Farewell."

cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains the lower part of a copy of a petition which is practically completely preserved in P. Mich. inv. 1440 (a subsequent copy composed, cf. palaeographical description): inv. 1436, lines 2-10 recur in inv. 1440, lines 11-17. In this petition Isidoros, son of Isidoros, from Sophthis in the Memphite nome, protests the illegal behaviour of Tryphon, the strategos of the Arsinoite nome. Through his agents, Tryphon appears to have forced Isidoros to make s sworn statement (cheirographia) regarding the sowing of seed grain land at Philadelphia. Although Isidoros submitted the cheirographia as directed (inv. 1440.16 = inv. 1436.8-9), he came to resent the compulsion put upon him by Tryphon and his agents, and to consider the imposition, because he was from Sophthis in the Memphite nome, which was Isidoros&apos; idia, and where he was registered for tax purposes.
