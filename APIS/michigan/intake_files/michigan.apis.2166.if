cu500_t | 1 | To Antaios, epistates of Philadelphia, from Demetrios, son of Kephalon. I am wronged by &apos;one&apos; Pasinosiris, and Theodotos, &apos;son of Apytos&apos;, and Horos, &apos;son of Pesais&apos;, the desert guard. Pasinosiris, owing me for olives 1300 drachmai [[and]] &apos;from the 5th day of Mecheir of the 12th year, and&apos; having given as a pledge for this sum a small hoe(?), a shovel, a necklace, and four drachmai in silver coin, up to the present does not redeem them although he promised to do so on the following day. And the other, Theodotos, having given a chiton and a cup as a pledge for 475 drachmai which he owed in like manner for olives, neither does he redeem them though he promised likewise to do so on the following day. And Horos, owing &apos;from the same month&apos; for wine 340 drachmai of copper and having given a chiton as pledge, neither does he redeem it. Thefore I ask you to summon them and if they do not undertake even now to redeem them, to render a decision so that it may no longer be possible for the man who refused (to pay) to bring suit in the future regarding the pledges. For if this is dore I shall secure justice. Farewell.
