cu500 | 1 | Since in the reference list were mentioned both fragmnets as of the same size, we cannot know which one (of these two pieces) is inv. 205 and which one inv. 230. They were both in the same folder (205 + 230)

cu500_pal | 1 | Top margin is 1,7 cm. On the left of the column there are some letters writen smaller than the main text. They are marginal notes? Also the same notes were written on the top margin of the 230. Generally the text was written by  a very experient hand, with letters standing separate from each other, avoiding many ligatures.
