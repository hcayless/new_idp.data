cu500_t | 1 | "Dionysios to his esteemed Theon, greetings. See to it, if you think best, that the cattle of Fabius remain with you until the 12th in order that they may begin their pasture-feeding on the 13th. For this was your idea, that the vegetable seed that has been sown may have advantage of the progress of the irrigation, before the grazing. Bring six bundles of charlock . . . of Antonia. Accordingly, when you come you can examine them. Give the saddle-pack to Philas, and the crock of the dovecotes, and also thecloth. Order papyrus to be given to me. I pray for your health, most esteemed . . . Tybi 9."

cu520 | 1 | This text contains a letter from Dionysios to Theon concerning farm matters. Theon is urged by Dionysios to see to it that the cattle of Fabius remain where they are until the 12th of Tybi so that they may begin their pasture-feeding on the 13th. Dionysios points out that this woould be in keeping with Theon&apos;s own idea that the vegetable seed that had been sown should be irrigated before the pastures. The addressee is also asked to bring six bundles of charlock.
