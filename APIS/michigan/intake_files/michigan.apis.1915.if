cu300 | 1 | 1 papyrus ; 12.5 x 17.5 cm.
cu500 | 2 | Location: Ann Arbor
cu500 | 4 | Pub. status: Recto; Verso is blank
cu500_lin | 1 | 1-19
cu500_pal | 1 | A rather cursive hand. The bottom part of the wide right hand margin continues for some 2 cm below where the wrting breaks off but shows no further traces of ink. Although this makes it appear that only one or two lines might be missing from the foot of the petition, it is much more likely that the closing lines which we expect in this type of document, giving the date of the petition, did not extend as far to the right as the body of the text. Consequently they have left no trace at the right hand edge of the papyrus.
