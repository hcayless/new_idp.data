cu500_pal | 1 | The ink is black but not very dark, and has rubbed away almost entirely in the region just to the left of the kollesis. The scribe wrote quickly, in a clear but graceless hand with few ligatures and a slight rightward slant. The script is similar to, but less elegant than, the hands of P. Oxy. X 1231 and XXVI 2441 (E. G. Turner, Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World, Oxford 1971, pl. 17). The writer observed carefully the verticality of the left edge of the column of writing and maintained reasonably straight lines.

cu520 | 1 | The text, which is objectively phrased, provides for the four-year leasing of four and a half arouras near the Oxyrhynchite village of Kerkeura, for agricultural use. Neither lessor, Harthonis son of Sarapas, nor the lessee, Onnophris, who is designated Perses tes epigones and whose patronymic is lost, can be readily recognized. The rate of rent, the usual guaranties and possibly other provisions have been lost.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is medium to dark brown, roughly rectangular and coarsely made. Gaps were left between some horizontal fibers, with the result that writing is sometimes found on the vertical layer. About 2 cm. from the right edge is a kollesis, to the right of which letters have been lost from most, or all, lines (see line 8). At the bottom the papyrus is nearly intact, with margins of about 2 cm. surviving at the left and top. There are three horizontal folds, about 2 cm. apart.
