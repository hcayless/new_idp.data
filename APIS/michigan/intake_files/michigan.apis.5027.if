cu590_con | 1 | Dark brown papyrus. It lost the margins at the four sides. In addition to three vertical folds it seems that the papyrus was diagonally folded twice. It suffered damage at many parts as a result of the folds and it broke off at four sides. There is a Kollesis at the left hand side but it doesn‚ÇÖt run to the top because the papyrus is broken off. Some fibers are either folded or misaligned or frayed.
