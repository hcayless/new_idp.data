Dux. And send a man to the field of Julius, to the place of Enoch the peasant, if he finds (?) the place on which he is, and take the two yoke of oxen and go north to the estate, and haul them in for him. For he has written me that he won&apos;t work (?) upon it, not half a day (?) . . . . . . . . . . . I greet your most pious Sonship (?).
