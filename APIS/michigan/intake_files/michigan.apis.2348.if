cu500_pal | 1 | The scribe&apos;s rather informal style suggests the 10th or the 11th century A.D.; not dissimilar are the hands of I.1.b.664 and 696: see A. I. Elanskaya, The Literary Coptic Manuscripts in the A. S. Pushkin State Fine Arts Museum in Moscow, Vigilae Christianae Suppl. 18 (1994), 68 and 378 (plates XXVIII/XXIX and CXLI/CXLII).;The leaf bears the page numbers "39" and "40" in the upper exterior corner of each side and "2", designating the second quinternion, appears in the upper interior corner of "40".

cu500_t | 1 | (Recto): ""... to find places that it (sc. repentance) may dwell in them, in order that it may cause them to mount upon the cross and may strip them of the passions, as the Apostle said concerning the Lord, who became a type for us in everything, in order that, having nailed it to the cross, having stripped from himself the principalities and the authorities - in order for the impure passions to flee (?) - , having manifested them, having condemned them openly in it, they might say: They nailed him, and he divested (?) himself of all (?) the passions, that the sounds of the word . . ., that the holy fear ..., if it is the fear of God that is (?) in the heart, he said (?) ..., but (?)...";(Verso): "... when he arose with the new, he said: Christ died, and he arose. He died, not in order to return to death, for death is not lord over him. As for the death which he died, it is for sin that he died once, and as for the life which he lived, it is for God that he lived. Therefore do not let sin reign in your body, which is wont to die, in order for you to obey its desires, nor present your limbs, as instruments of iniquity, to sin, but present yourselves to God, as being alive out of the dead, and your limbs as instruments of righteousness, to God. For sin will not be lord over you ..."
