cu500_t | 1 | "To Aurelius Apollonios, defensor, from Aurelius Hestiodorus of the same city. <We believed that> the agreed upon and admitted documents remained enforceable, firm and unshaken, since they are guarded by both the laws and the excellence of the person in whom we have put our trust. Well, because of wages, our brother Kepion, while he was still alive, drew up a written document of a deed of gift towards me of one room in the house that belonged to him . . .".

cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains the upper part of a petition to the defensor of an unknown civitas. Hestiodorus received from his brother Kepion while the latter was still alive a room in his house. Probably because there are now difficulties after Kepion&apos;s death concerning this room, Hestiodorus addresses the defensor civitatis.
