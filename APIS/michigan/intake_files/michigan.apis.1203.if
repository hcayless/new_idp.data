cu500_pal | 1 | A hand that became fixed at an early stage of development, which [could] be called a &apos;retarded&apos; hand; the letter-forms are such that they could easily have been adapted to genuinely cursive writing, but here they stand, almost without exception, in isolation, [without ligatures]; the hand is definitely not skillful; it is nevertheless the hand of someone who wrote with confidence. (Youtie)

cu500_t | 1 | Thermouthis to Nemesion, greetings. I want you to know that Lucius has come. About his smock of coarse sackcloth, which you have in the city, if you come down bring it. He has the hood (soubrikos) here. I gave it to him some time ago on his word alone, so that he might have it until you come down. And about the shepherds&apos; wages, he said, "I am sending a soldier . . . immediately," he says, "to seize such of the shepherds belongings as are still in place." He has not given me our mattress. "Bring me my old one," he says. And about the shovel, he says that you asked them for three staters per shovel. Farewell. Year 5 of Nero, Epeiph 13.;;(2 lines of another text, written in the opposite direction by a different but equally unsophisticated hand. An attempt was made to wash off the text. - Too fragmentary to be translated.);;(Verso);;Deliver to Nemesion
