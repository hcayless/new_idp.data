cu500_pal | 1 | Written along the fibers in medium-cursive letters with ligatures; the hand is fast but experient and ornamental. The interlinear spaces are almost even of about 0.6 cm. The scribe draws his delta with a horizontal curved head sloping diagonally down towards the left side with a semi cycle in the middle. So much similar is the Phi except for the horizontal curved stroke.

cu590_con | 1 | Dark brown papyrus. Only a part of the top margin is survived at the right hand side. There are a couple dark spots at the top and the bottom. In addition to three vertical folds it seems that the papyrus was diagonally folded twice. It suffered damage at many parts as a result of the folds and it broke off at four sides. Some fibers are either folded or misaligned or frayed.
