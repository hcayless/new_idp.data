cu500_t | 1 | To Markos Oulpios Herkoulanos, alias Herakleides, priest and exegetes, and to the Caesarii and other prytaneis.;From Pelops son of Pelops of the Propappodebasteian tribe and Zeneian deme, one of those who entered the ephebate in the eighth year of Divus Vespasianus. Since my son Pelops born to me from Sarapias daughter of ...eios (?), citizeness who is absent in the districts above Memphis, is of an age for introduction into the ephebes, and wishing to induct him into the ephebes of the present seventheenth year of Imperator Caesar Nerva Trajanus Germanicus Dacicus, I respect you to instruct the officials in charge of these matters ...
cu510 | 2 | Whitehorne J, PBingen , 285-287, no 68, 2000, Pl. 37 -- On the back there is one line broken at some point because the vertical fibers have been lost , and continued after 1.6 cm for about 0.5 cm and then is broken again. The preserved part consists of about 6-7 letters, which run vertical to the fibers. Only PSI XII 1226 has a note on the back "HYPOMNEMA EPHEBEIAS" of the person. However, a phrase like "HYPOMNEMA EPHEBEIAS PELOPOS PELOPOS" cannot be read. (NL; forthcoming)

cu520 | 1 | An application by Pelops, son of Pelops, an Alexandrian resident in the chora, for the eiskrisis or examination of his son, who was also called Pelops, for admission to the Alexandrian ephebate.;The present text follows the pattern which we would expect from these parallels, with one slight exception. After Pelops senior has given the name, patronymic nd ciziten status of the boy&apos;s mother Sarapias (lines 7-8), he then goes on to state that she is presently absent from home (lines 8-9). This may suggest (although it does not prove) that it may have been an official requirement for entry  into the ephebate that both parents were present in person to bring their son forward at the eiskrisis ceremony.
