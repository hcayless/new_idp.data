cu500 | 1 | This papyrus was put in the folder 5622. But the "reference list" and the folder with the history of the papyrus did not mention it at all. Petra Sijpesteijn joined it with the inventory no 5613, for which the reference list entries"large fragments from several Arabic documents". (without stating how many). There is no folder with the history of this papyrus. Therefore, even though we keep the inv. 5622, we name it as 5622A, but the papyrus seems to be actually inv. 5613.
