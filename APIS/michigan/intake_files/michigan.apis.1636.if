cu500_t | 1 | Satornilos to Aphrodous, his mother, very many greetings. Before all things I pray for your health and prosperity. I wish you to know that I sent you three letters this month. I have received in full the monthly allowances which you sent to me by Iulius and a basket of olives by the lad of Iulius. I wish you to know that another male child has been born to me, whose name is Agathos Daimon. The gods willing, if I find an opportunity of putting my plan into effect I am coming to you with letters. I wish you to know that it is now three months since I came to Pselkis, and I have not yet found an opportunity to come to you. I was afraid to come just now because they say: that the prefect is on the road, lest he take the letters from me and send me back to the troops, and I incur the expense in vain. But I wish you to know that  if another two months pass and I do not come to you before the month Hathyr I have eighteen more months of sitting ingarrison until I enter Pselkis again and come to you. All those who come will bear witness to you how I seek daily to come. If you wish to see me a little, I wish it greatly and pray daily to the gods that they may quickly give me a good chance to come. Everything in the army runs with the favorable chance. If I have the opportunity I am coming to you. Take care of my children&apos;s pigs for me so that if my children come they may find them. At the next opportunity please send to Ioulas, the son of Iulius, whatever allowance you can, and let him be as a son of mine, even as you love me and I [love] my children. If his brother is at leisure send him to me at once so that I may send my children and their mother to you by him. [Send] me an extra jar of olives for a friend of mine; do not fail to [do] so. You know that whatever you give to Iulius he brings me, which he indeed promised me to do. Write to me [whatever] he does. Salute Sokmenios and his children and [. . .] and Sabinus and Thaisas and her children and my brothers and my sister Tabenka and her husband and her relations-in-law. And write to me if she has had a child. Salute Tasokmenis, my lady sister, and Sambas and Soueris and her [children] and Sambous and all the relations and friends, [each by name]. Gemella salutes you all, as do Didymarion and the [newly-born] Agathos Daimon and Epiktetos. Salute Gemellus [and . . .] the wife of [. . .]lianus. And it was no great matter [- - -]. I pray for health to you all.;[The . . . year of Trajan], most Excellent, Caesar, our lord. Phaophi 25.;;(Verso);;To Karanis; to his mother(?) Aphrodous(?), the daughter of . . ., from Saturnilus, a soldier.
