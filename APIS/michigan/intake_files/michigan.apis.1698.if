cu500_t | 1 | To Quintus Aemilius Saturninus, prefect of Egypt, from Gemellus also called Horion, son of Gaius Apolinarius, Antinoite, and however he is styled, landholder at Karanis in the division of Herakleides of the Arsinoite nome. Some time ago, my lord, our father died, leaving me and my sister as heirs, and we took over his possessions, without opposition from anyone. Likewise it came to pass that my uncle also, Gaius Iulius Longinus, died eight years ago, and I entered into ownership of his property and collected the income, without hindrance from anyone. But now Iulius and Sotas, both sons of Eudas, wrongfully, with violence and arrogance, entered my fields after I had sown them and hindered me therein through the power which they exercise in the locality, contemptuous of me on account of my weak vision. Wherefore I have fled to you, the savior, asking you, if it seem good to your Fortune, to hear my complaint against them, so that I may be able to recover my property and receive this benefaction from your hands my lord.  Farewell.;(2nd hand) [[I, Gemellus also called Horion, have submitted this petition. I, Sabinus, wrote for him . . . .]]
