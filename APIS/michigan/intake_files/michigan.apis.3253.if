cu500_t | 1 | To Praiylos, strategos of Small Oasis (?) [   ] from Kastor, son of Harmatis and Demarous, chief-priest in the same Oasis through NN, son of Tachonsis from the village Seryphis. For  --- bad --- behaviour against me, but also --- petition --- was sent by --- at the time of Acylius Capitolinus, epistrategos [and subscribed: Meet?]--- the Idiologos --- until the matter is finished at the presence of the illoustrious prefect with the Idiologos.

cu510 | 2 | Lewis N, RechPap 3, 29, 1964 -- SB VIII 9905 -- BL VII, 215; BL VIII, 356; BL IX, 267; There is doubt about the reading of the nome at the end of line 1; see BL IX 267, cf. P.Oxy. LV 3781, 20-23n.). After "praiulo stratego", there is a blank space of 2.8 cm until some traces of ink reappear, but the horizontal fibers of the papyrus are lost at this point, and thus, it is difficult to read either "mikras oaseos" or "oksurugxitou". In line 16 after "archierateusas" the reading "tes oaseos" is also doubtful and certainly the restoration "tes oaseos metr[opoleos" (see BL, loc. cit., cf. Wagner, Les Oasis, p. 254, n. 7) is impossible. I read line 16 with a feeling of uncertainty "tos archierateusas epidedoka os p[rokeitai"  (NL; forthcoming)
