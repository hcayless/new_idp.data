cu500_t | 1 | To Antonius Colonianus, the most noble epistrategos, from Gellius Serenus and Gemellus Horion and the rest of the landowners and public cultivators of the village of Kerkesoucha.;First of all, most excellent of governors, those who serve as prefect from time to time, devoting forethought to the land, issue written orders concerning the accomplishment of the labor of maintenance on the dikes and canals. And although we were as always most zealously prepared to perform fully the labors that pertain to the land, the supervisors of sowing for the Argaitis bowl in the present 19th year, for some unknown reason, or through simple negligence, did not produce the wood and materials which are annually provided by them for the reconstruction of the wattled weir, in the vicinity of the same village, called the "Log", nor did they in any way provide for maintenance, (2nd hand) &apos;as if (without the least?) suspicion of the fact that canals make the difference (between success and failure)&apos;. (1st hand) Since the land runs the risk of going dry on this account and inflicting injury  on the most sacred treasury in the matter of the dues paid for these (arourai), which come to not a few myriads (of artabai), at a time when the most sacred Nile has shown himself most favorable to us for a good issue, we request, if it seems best to your beneficient genius, that you order with your (characteristic) vigor that the work be done, <so that> we may be able blamelessly to maximise the imminent sowing - may it be for good ! - and nothing be lost to the most sacred treasury.
