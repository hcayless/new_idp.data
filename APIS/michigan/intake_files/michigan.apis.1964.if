cu500_t | 1 | "Herakleides to my father Heroninos, greeting. You should have sent . . . the cowhers together with the cows, as I . . . instructed Sarapion, without (needing) a letter (to remind you), but indeed you did this (i. e. you delayed unduly), a thing not alien to your indifference. But I also instructed you concerning the turnip seeds, and you didn&apos;t do this either. Do you now at last send both the cowherd and the cows to the settlement, and by way of replacing 2 artabas of turnip seeds, 2 jars of radish oil, as I instructed you, a jar of vinegar, and . . . of dates. Have Eutychos collect from the shepherd Asios 600 drachmas, for he did not even come up here to me. Having got money from him, give it to the vine-dressers if . . . and send the rest of the breed to the builders, 44 double loaves. I pray for your good health."
