cu500_t | 1 | I, Onnophris, son of Hatres, my mother being Thenapsemis, acknowledge that I have sold, in accordance with the Egyptian contracts, to Kollouthos, son of Mieus, his mother being Taorsenouphis, the one-story house that belongs to me, with the courtyard and all the appurtenances in Tebtynis, the measurements of which are from south to north nine and one-half cubits, from west to east sixteen cubits, to the total extent of the measurements in cubits, or as many more as there may be. The neighbors are on the south the house and court of Horos, son of Harmiysis, and the house and court of others formerly those of Kyrtos, on the north the house of Assar, on the west the house of Taorsenouphis, daughter of Kollouthos, and in part the court of Harmiysis, the fuller, on the east the royal road. And I have received from Kollouthos the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee with every guarantee from public and private debts and from every claim forever, and <I shall relinquish the house> neither previously sold, nor mortgaged, nor alienated in any way at all. My mother, Thenapsemis, daughter of Orseus, agrees [- - -]
