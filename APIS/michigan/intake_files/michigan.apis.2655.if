cu500 | 1 | The gray clay seal (originally 2.5 cm in diameter) shows the bust of a bearded figure facing right in the upper left, and in the center below an Apis bull standing right. On the basis of the inscription running around the edge the bust may be identified as that of Septimius Severus; the missing upper right part of the seal probably contained a similar bust of Caracalla facing left.
