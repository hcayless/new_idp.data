cu500_pal | 1 | The letters epsilon, theta, omicron, sigma are narrow, while mu is broad. Theta is especially narrow and its horizontal bar extends only to the right. Sigma is not lunate, but resembles that of a cursive hand. In some cases delta and chi have a hook on top of their left bar (see vv. 493 and 495 respectively). The horizontal stroke of delta is extended on both ends, especially on the right (e.g. v. 460). Some letters that have a descender touch on the following line (e.g. the iota in rigmeni of 1.501). kappa is written in two parts. The only diacritic used in the surviving text is diaeresis over iota. The scribe does not write iota  adsecriptum; see. V. 471 e]thlectha, v. 475 prymnes[I and v. 476 aino]tatw. The handwriting can be classified as ‚Ç£formal mixed‚Ç¥ in the category of ‚Ç£sloping oval style‚Ç¥.
