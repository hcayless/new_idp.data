cu518 | 1 | Polemon meris, Arsinoite nome, province of Egypt
cu520 | 1 | One of six fragments of papyrus in the University of Michigan Papyrus Collection that once formed part of a tomos synkollesimos are gathered under inv. no. 145. These six documents list the workers who performed their penthemeros in different localities in the Polemon meris in the Arsionite nome from August 21 through August 25, 154 A.D. Due to the fragmentary state of the text we do not have the exact location where the work recorded in this text took place.
