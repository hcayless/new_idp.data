cu520 | 1 | The text on this side of the papyrus is the upper portion of the first column of a roll devoted to a sitologos report. The sitologoi of the village Philopator also called of Theogenes here present an itemized journal of receipts of transportation charges on wheat moved from the granary to the harbour at Kerke. Neither the name nor the title of the official to whom the document was sent is recorded, but he was presumably the strategos (cf. P. Berl. Leihg. I, 1, introd.).

cu590_con | 1 | This medium brown papyrus is broken off at the bottom. Perhaps as much as one-half of the column has been lost at the bottom. The major difficulty of transcription arises from the severe abrasion of the ink along the left side of the column.
