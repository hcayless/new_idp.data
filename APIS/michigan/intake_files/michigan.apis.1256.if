cu500_pal | 1 | When the note was paid the contract was cancelled by drawing a series of heavy strokes, in the form of the letter X, over the entire face of the loan. The upper two series of these cross strokes are large, the first row covering ll. 1-5, the second row ll. 5-10. The remaining six rows of cross strokes are, roughly, half the size of the upper rows. The body of the document is written in an irregular hand, varying from a carefully formed uncial to a somewhat smaller cursive. The second hand, that of the lender, Heraclius, is semi-cursive and slovenly. Dionysius, the borrower (third hand), writes in heavy crude uncials. The clerk who countersigned the document for the office of the nomographus (fourth hand) writes in uncials with few ligatures, rather finely, with self-conscious effort.

cu590_con | 1 | Light brown papyrus regularly cut off, except in bottom right corner and lower left side, where a significant part of the papyrus is lost. The loss of text, however, is insignificant and the missing may be easily restored. A few other minor abrasions scattered around on the document, although these are too small to be serious. (TC)
