cu500_pal | 1 | The hand, being a fairly rapid cursive, varies in size and texture throughout. There is severe compression of letters, particularly at the end of line 5 and much of line 6. The greater part of line 6 is faded or lost. The left side suggests an irregular margin slanting outward. The top of the papyrus has 1 cm. blank and the bottom part 2.5 cm. blank.

cu590_con | 1 | This light-brown papyrus is complete. Worm holes are scattered throughout the document, especially in lines 2,3, and 6, causing some difficulty in reading. A pattern of vertical holes evident proportionately on both left and right sides of the document suggests perhaps its shape when found: folded horizontally. Two large holes on the right side of lines 2 and 3,a nd two others equal in size on the left side of line 6 supports such a pattern.
