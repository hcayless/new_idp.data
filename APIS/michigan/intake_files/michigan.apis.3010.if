cu520 | 1 | The text contains a record of collections, largely at Sinary, in money, followed by a short list of wheat collections at a number of villages. The only charges mentioned by name are rent, adaeratio of wheat, and the beer tax. The collocation of dues paid in money and in kind suggests an account prepared by the supervisory bureau of the nome, to which the diverse local agencies responsible for their collection submitted reports.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus preserves one column out of a roll which may have been very extensive. Meager remnants of a preceding and following column are preserved on the irregular left and right edges of the sheet. The upper edge is similarly broken, and much of the margin has been lost; but at the bottom the original is preserved 5 cm. below the text. A vertical break runs down the middle of the sheet to the level of line 13. The writing is interrupted by numerous large and small holes, and occasional abrasions, but has suffered significant damage in a few lines only. Large dark patches of soil attached to the papyrus on the back.
