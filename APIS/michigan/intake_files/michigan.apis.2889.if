cu500_t | 1 | To Apollonios, strategos of the Arsinoite nome, from Petsiris, son of Phoulemis, a resident of Talei. On the 5th of Tybi of the present 8th year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, while I was at work in the vineyard, which I have rented from Ischyrion, son of Ptolemaios, near Talei, I found Patynion, son of Herakleides, and his son . . . in the act of driving . . . mules among the vegetables sown between the vine stocks, and when I remonstrated with them, they both heaped unseemly insults upon me and in addition beat me unmercifully on any part of my body that they could, and struck me on the side with their fists, so that now I am confined to bed and am in danger of my life. Therefore I ask you to write to the archephodos of Talei to send the accused to you for the coming assizes. Farewell.;The eighth year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, Tybi 9. Petsiris, about 45 years old, bald, with a scar on the top of his left eyebrow along the edge.
