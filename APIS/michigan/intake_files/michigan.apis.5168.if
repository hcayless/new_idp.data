cu520 | 1 | Salama b. Iy»Ìs begins his letter to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad with long and unusual blessings which cannot be completely restored due to the damaged state of the papyrus. He then asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to buy him one din»Ìr worth of fresh radish oil as part of a standing order telling him to wait until oil from the new press is available. He supports his request by adding that of the members of his qawm √¨Abd All»Ìh is closest to him. When sending the oil to Salama, √¨Abd All»Ìh is to make sure he does it safely, meaning presumably with a trustworthy person. Salama then writes that he has sent √¨Abd All»Ìh some small quantity of wool and some sheep fat. Finally, he mentions a certain √¨Amr and his wife Nur but their relationship with Salama is lost.;The following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).

Five large holes on the right half of the papyrus caused a loss of one word in eight lines. There are two vertical folding lines visible along which the fibers have gotten slightly damaged.
