cu500_t | 1 | Ammonios to his most esteemed Sabinus, very many greetings. Apollinarius wrote me that he has been given an assignment by Valerius Pius and has become his aide. At the same time he informed me that Valerius should write to him (Valerius Pius), thanking him and accepting the position and assurance which have been given him, in order that wherever he (Valerius Pius or Apollinarius?]) goes he may have him (Valerius) with himself. I therefore beg you, brother, to act again in my place and urge Valerius to write to Pius, relying on my good faith and assurance, so that in every way you may be not only a helper in the affair but also a good pilot, restoring a son to his father. If perchance . . . when the moment comes to sail down, let me know and I will come to you at once. I trust you, however, to show no hesitation whatsoever in the aforesaid matter. Before all else I pray for your health. Farewell, most esteemed Sabinus.;;(Verso) To Iulius Sabinus, standard bearer, from Ammonios, his friend.
