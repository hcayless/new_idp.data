cu500_t | 1 | [- - - to Zenon greeting. Of the] four awnings which were ordered on contract [. . .] three are now finished, quite plain, [two of them . . cubits long and] 4 broad, and the third 61 cubits long [and . . broad. We will bring them down] in our Kasiote boat [and you should pay the price of them] to the account of the Crown; for they say that this is how [we should settle]. They were [contracted] for here at 80 drachmai each. Attend to this matter [then as soon as you have time], in order that [. . .] may not accuse me of negligence. Farewell. Year 29, Pachons 13.
