But I, Arsinoe, shall at my own cost and expense prosecute anyone who proceeds or brings any charge against Herakleides or Ptolema or their male children in the name of me, Arsinoe. And I shall do the rest as aforesaid. I, Lysimachos, wrote for my wife because she is illiterate, and I have been registered as her guardian.;(3rd and) Herakleides the younger, son of Maron, and my wife, Ptolema, daughter of Herodes, with her guardian, me, her husband, Herakleides.
