cu590_con | 1 | The text is on the back of two glued-together, unidentified documents, possibly an official tomos synkollesimos or a private file. It is also possible that unrelated documents were pasted together in order to create a surface to receive the Iliad text. In any case, the documnets were arranged in such a way as to preserve legibility; this argues in favor of a tomos or file but does not rule out the other possibility. One of the documents ca. 8.5 cm wide, contains scattered writing b one hand; the other, ca 2 cm wide, contains 3, possibly 4 hands and may be a register of some kind. The two pieces of papyrus are similar in texture and color, both smooth and light-brown. The Iliad text, which is the beginning of a column is written in dark-brown or black ink.
