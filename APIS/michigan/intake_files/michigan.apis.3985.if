cu590_con | 1 | There are three more folders with many written fragments of various sizes, but they do not belong to the same roll. They are accounts or documents mentioning "logos", "praepositus", "puros", "knidia", "elaion", "geouchos", "kamelo[ ]". And in one I could read "Philadelph[ ]".  These are  re-named as "P.Cornell inv. I 116B". Many of them join together.
