cu500_pal | 1 | It belonged to a roll of papyrus of a medium brown color and fair quality. The ink is a good black. At one place the upper margin has been preserved in what was probbaly its original height, 1.9 cm. The second column is 4.5 cm wide, and the lines contain from 19 to 23 letters. The intercolumnar space is about 1.8 cm. The hand is a small uncial, neat yet not quite regular. Some of the letters are slightly inclined, but the writing is clearly earlier than the well-marked sloping hands of the third century. The omicron is small in proportion to the other letters, and the omega has in its base only a slight wave, which disappears in a few of the examples. ;The orthography is correct (except one iotacism in col. III, 11). The iota adscript is used in Col. II, 8-10, but is omitted in l.1. A diaeresis is placed over iota in Col. II, 6 and space fillers stand at the ends of Col. I, 9 and Col. II, 7. A short stroke under line 8 of col. III may be a paragraphus. There are on other marks of punctuation, although a slight space before "o de" (Col. III, 7) may indicate a minor pause.
