I acknowledge that I have received and have had measured out from you, from the wheat crop of the past 4th year, six and a half artabai, with interest on the principal of an equal amount; total, thirteen artabai. <And these I will return by such-and-such a date> without any delay or excuse. And if I do not make the repayment as I have had written, I will pay the stated capital plus one-half, and also an addition for the overtime, with the paralemptic measure of Nicias the agoranome, by which I received the loan. And you shall have the right of execution against me and all my property as if in consequence of a court decision.
