cu520 | 1 | letter of N»Ìjid b. Muslim to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad deals with several tax related issues, possibly involving taxes paid in kind. N»Ìjid asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to send him someone, possibly the same person responsible for the tax-collection (of sheep?) in a village and a hayyiz he refers to later in his letter. N»Ìjid mentions that he has sent draft animals (daww»Ìb) to √¨Abd All»Ìh perhaps to transport the taxes, and he asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to hand over the taxes in one payment. On two matters he orders √¨Abd All»Ìh not to act before he receives a letter from him.;The following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
