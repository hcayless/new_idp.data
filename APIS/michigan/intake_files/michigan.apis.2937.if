cu245ab | 1 | Dictionary of metamorphosed characters from myth
cu245f | 1 | (late) IInd century A.D. / IIIrd century A.D.
cu300 | 1 | 4 papyri ; fr. 1: 16.5 x 18 cm; fr. 2: 2.2 x 6.2 cm; fr. 3: 2.4 x 2.4 cm; fr. 4: 1.3 x 2 cm
cu500 | 2 | Location: Ann Arbor
cu500 | 4 | Pub. status: Verso; Recto is unpublished
cu500_lin | 1 | col. I: 22 lines; col. II:21 lines
cu500_pal | 1 | Handwriting: rounded informal capital by a practised scribe. Some variations of stance, shape and proportion of letters occur. The lower margin is preserved to its original depth, 4.3-5.4 cm, for most of the width of the papyrus. There is an intercolumnar space of around 1.8 cm at the top of the text; but as a result of the scribe&apos;s tendency in col. I to end his lines successively further to the right, this space is steadily reduced until it dwindles to almost nothing near the lower margin. But the edge itself of col. I is even. The left edge of col. II is also straight but is almost exactly perpendicular as well. The entries are separated from one another by spaces about the height of one line of writing. Critical signs: forked paragraphos. Punctuation: a low stop (II, 6); two tremata (diaeresis). No accents and one breathing. Several misspellings and errors, some corrected; iota adscript consistently written.

cu520 | 1 | A mythological dictionary. The five nearly complete entries in Column II all concern metamorphosed characters in Greek myth whose names begin with "alpha", but they are not ordered according to any stricter rules of alphabetization. Two of these entries cite the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, the Ethoiae, as their authorities. A Third cites simply "Hesiod", and a fourth entry refers to an unknown passage of Aeschylus.;The scanty remains of col. I apparently represent three entries having eight, eleven and three lines respectively preserved.

cu590_con | 1 | The ends of 22 lines from one column and the greater part of 21 lines from a second column. Both columns are incomplete above. Full of creases and fiber dislocations. The surface, usually a medium brown, has been darkened by discoloration in several areas, and much of the text is peppered with holes. The unusual straightness of the top edge of the fragmentmay have resulted from a cut in antiquity. Three small scraps, designated Fr. 2, 3 and 4, have become detached from the main piece but can be replaced in their respective original locations at the top left of col. I and at the right of col. II.
