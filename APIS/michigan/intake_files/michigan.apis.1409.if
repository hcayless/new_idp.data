cu500_t | 1 | Paniskos, to my wife Ploutogenia, mother of my daughter, very many greetings. First <of all> I pray daily for your good health in the presence of all the gods. I would have you know then, sister, that we have been staying in Koptos near [[my]] your sister and her children, so that you may not be grieved about coming to Koptos; for your kinsfolk are here. And just as you desire above all to greet her with many greetings, so she prays daily to the gods desiring to greet you along with your mother. So when you have received this letter of mine make your preparations in order that you may come at once if I send for you. And when you come, bring ten shearing of wool, six jars of olives, four jars of honeyed wine (stagma), and my shield, the new one only, and my helmet. Bring also my lances. Bring also the fittings of the tent. If you find an opportunity, come here with good men. Let Nonnos come with you. Bring all our clothes when you come. When you come, bring your gold ornaments, but;(continued in the left margin:) do not wear them on the boat.;;(Verso);;I salute my lady daughter Heliodora. Hermias salutes you.;;(Address) Deliver to my wife and my daughter, from Paniskos, her father.
