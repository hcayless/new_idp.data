cu520 | 1 | This text contains the end of a private contract (cheirographon) which refers to a delivery to be made. This could be either a transportation or a sale, for which the price has been payed in advance. Of the agreement (omologia) only the final phrases remain, followed by the "validity clause" and the stipulatory clause in Greek (in plural), to which the Latin clause is joined, in the 3rd person sg. The absence of the signature is striking, and so is the absence of the date at the end of the document. The date, however, could have been placed at the beginning of the document in accordance with scribal practice.
