cu500_t | 1 | Ninnas to his most esteemed Silvanus, greetings. I wrote this letter to you at the harbor. None of your slave boys has given me anything of the things currently owed by them. But they have stood obdurate for the third day. And especially Euthyches who added a bit of insolence so that I had words with him when he was giving Turbon three artabas of vegetables and to Pieltis six artabas of wheat. And Apollos and Sarapion took up and went off with his spade on behalf of his debt. And he did not declare anything to me without being abusive and ordering me around. And they have not done anything of the works which you commanded them, not have they broken up any ground, since from the present time the necessary works are starting, which, when you come, you will see, and this will he be borne witness to. Nemesas brought to me today forty drachmas on behalf of an old account and says, "I shall take care of the rest." Please write so that I may send the rents to you, unless I am not able to send them. For I know that I have gone through quite a rough time. Greet Crispina and Diogena and Sabina and Strongulus. Everyone in the house greets you and they have sold the rest of the sweet olives. I pray for your good health. Tybi 3. To Hestia (send) two artabas of Borios&apos; black olives and to small Manes one and . . . artabas of sweet olives.";Verso: "To Julius Silvanus in Dios Polis from Ninnas".
