I shall repay the aforesaid capital to you within thirty days of request. I further acknowledge that if there is a separation while you are pregnant, I shall pay you, aside from the aforesaid capital, another 100 drachmai of silver for the expense of childbirth. If I do not make repayment [as written, I shall pay] you the aforesaid capital with a penalty of one-half, [and you have the right of exaction upon me and everything] I own.
