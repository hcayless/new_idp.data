cu500_pal | 1 | Written across the fibers in large-sized cursive rude hand with a very thick pen. The letters tend to be separated rather than ligature. The text is not clear enough because of the patches of mud that covers many parts.

cu590_con | 1 | This papyrus is dark brown in color; regularly cut at the top; the left side is regularly cut, probably as a result of a fold, to make a separate fragment (2 x 10 cm). It is also damaged at the middle as a result of another vertical fold. The papyrus is covered in some parts by a layer of mud. There are also blots of thick layer of mud on verso. In some parts the fibers are misaligned and removed in other parts. A vertical strip of fibers is removed at verso.
