cu500_t | 1 | Ptolemaios to Heron, his son, greeting. Until today we did not find a buyer. I am ceding everything to Didymos on condition that I receive a third part of the loan and of the rest. Except that I have had a dispute with Ptolemaios, we would have left long ago; for he was enraged when he came down. Therefore I am writing to you that you may know. Salute your children and all your household and Tais and her children. [I pray for your] good health.;(Verso) Deliver to Heron, boundary inspector.
