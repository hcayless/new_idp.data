cu500_pal | 1 | The handwriting of the papyri in group I (P. Mich. inv. 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 603) is extremely rude and uneven, as though produced by some nearly illiterate person who seldomhad occasion to write. The pen which he used was stiff and inelastic, and fed the ink badly, as though not properly split. The ink was too thick. The writer blotted letters or words, either by accident or because they did not suit him; and in the latter case he often repeated words standing before the blot. The whole performance suggests a negligent paralytic or a very young child. The letters are drawn, not written with the swing of an ordinary writer. For similar hands, cf. P. Mich. inv. 3565, British Museum MS No. 1224 (Catalogue of the Coptic Manuscripts in the British Museum (1905), Plate XII); a third is published by Crum(Receuil d&apos; 入tudes d权di权es a la m权moire de Jean Fran群ois Champollion (1922), Plate VII).;The handwriting of group II (P. Mich. inv. 600, 601, and 602)  is not entirely unpracticed, though not a book-hand. It varies in size, according to the available space, and tends to sprawl.;The handwriting of group III is of three sorts: (a) medium-sized and not very good (pp. 1-3, 19-20); (b) rather small and very good (pp. 4-12); (c) rather large and good (pp. 13-18). The third is comparable to that of the British Museum No. 951 (Cat., Plate IX). III would probably date around 600 A.D.

cu520 | 1 | Internally, the collection falls in three parts:;A. a magical text, represented by 593, and duplicated by nos. 599, 594, 603, and 596, in the order named;;B. Another magical text, or series of texts, represented by nos. 600, 601, and 602, duplicated in part by nos. 597 and 598.;C. A third magical text, represented by no. 595, possibly a part of B, and resembling slightly in phraseology the Michigan papyrus no. 594a.;One&apos;s first impression is that III (593) is the original from which the "rough copies," nos. 599, 594, 603, and 596, were made: by an apprentice or pupil of the magician, or by himself for sale, or by some unskilled who wished to save the cost of professional services. But collation of the two versions of the text reveals a different relationship. There are many cases of the same error in both. There are cases in which an error of the copies is paralleled by a further corruption, or a frank omission, or a simple emendation in the codex: as though the codex were itself dependent upon the copies. In fact, the copies are right and the codex wrong in so many cases that one must regard the copies as older and better than the codex. But there are enough cases in which the codex corrects the copies to prevent assuming that the codex was made directly from the copies. They have a common ancestry, and the copies are in the better line. Perhaps the copies were made from a good manuscript when still in good condition, and the codex from the same manuscript after it had become old.
