cu510 | 2 | Sijpesteijn PJ, PMich XIII, 667, 1977, Pl. XXVI -- L. 4: Psentouses (or is it Psentases?) may be the name of the holding (ktema) leased to Phoibammon (as in the index of P.Mich. XIII, p. 132) rather than the name of a small monastery dependent from the bigger monastery of Apa Sourous. (PH); BL XI, 133 (For David, cf. P. Hamb. IV 265, l. 12)
