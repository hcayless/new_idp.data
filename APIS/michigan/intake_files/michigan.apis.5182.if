cu590_con | 1 | Small fragment papyrus of dark brown color; broken off at the left, right and bottom. The top margin is preserved. As a result of a horizontal fold this fragment is broken off at the middle and it wrongly has been reassembled. It has been folded at the lower part to the right side, and fibers are misaligned.
