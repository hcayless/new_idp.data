cu500_pal | 1 | Written in a hand which points to IInd/Ist century B.C. for the dating of the text, cf. W. Schubart, Papyri Graecae Berolinenses, Bonn 1911, Tafel 9 [127 B.C.] and R. Seider, Palaeographie der griechischen Papyri I, Stuttgart 1967, Tafel 18 [101 B.C.]. At the left there is a margin of 1 cm. and at the bottom one of approximately 4 cm. The text is heavily abbreviated and a Ptolemaic date for this text appears to be confirmed by the occurence in the text of many words only attested in the Ptolemaic period.
