cu500_t | 1 | To my lord husband Aeis, son of Apion, greeting, and to Kopres, son of Palemon, greeting. If you can, come to us immediately, since they subject us to much torment, in order that you may find out what they are doing to us and that you may pay a visit to my property. See to it that they do not let it go without seeding; give it out for cultivation. And do you, Aeis, neglect this. Come to see me in the city after you find out, but do not neglect it.
