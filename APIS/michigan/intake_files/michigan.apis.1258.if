cu500 | 1 | The editors of P.Corn did not know about the first publication of ll. 1-13 by Lefebvre in ASAE 10, 1910, 170 and the republication in SB I, 5807 in 1915, so they wrote that their place of origin is Fayum. The papyrus was in a private collection before bought by Cornell in the second purchase in1922. According to the first edition the papyrus comes from Theadelphia, Fayum (trouvee parmi les ruines d&apos;une maison de la ville) (NL)

cu500_t | 1 | Herakleides to Anchorimphis greeting. Please clean out the willows and lock out for a buyer for them. If you take a statement of sale (?) show it to me, but if you do not find a buyer, write to me again. When these must be cut in order that the vines may not be shaded too much, send me one kephalaion (wine measurement) since I am rather sickly. Goodby. Thoth 12. Write to me also how many animals of Papos are working and how many Dioskoras ...

cu520 | 1 | Herakleides, the writer was the owner of a farm which contained a palm grove with wines planted beneath the palms. These had reached such a height that the vines growing beneath them were receiving too much shade. Therefore it had become necessary to sacrifice the palms by cutting out the cabbage-like crowns at the top of the trunks. The letter mentions two laborers working on the farm, each with several of his own drafts animals. The farm property of Herakleides must therefore have been of considerable size.
