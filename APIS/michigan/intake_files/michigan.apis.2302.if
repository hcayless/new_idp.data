cu500_t | 1 | [Iulius] Germanus to Tasoucharion, his sister, very many greetings. Before all else, I pray that you be well; I myself am well, and I make your obeisance before the local gods. I received your letter from Secundus and was greatly delighted about the health of the children(?), and do you watch over them. I shall go to the mill(?) if I sift. For there are there two . .  . for all to take. I shall take them, and I shall not let them be . . . .  Salute Ptol[. . .]s, our brother. I as you, brother(?), keep watch over my sisters and Pais(?) and my mother . . . .  Salute . . . Aunes and our friends. I pray for your health.;;(Verso) Deliver to Karanis, to Tasoucharion, the daughter of Tapeesis, from Iulius Germanus, her brother.
