Peace be upon you and I praise for you God besides Whom there is no god but He. ;3. Further, may God preserve us and you from all evil and may He make paradise our and your resting place  ;4. through His mercy. And you have bought through me flax of √¨Ali b. Khawli as you already learned in Alexandria ;5. six . . . for a din»Ìr. And I wrote to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad that he give you what ;6. he has of . . . flax. And √¨Abd All»Ìh knows what the debt he is owed is and (what) he gave ;7. to you. And I have written to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad that he will receive the price from you. And we have billed (you for) ;8. your . . . since I purchased them, for you have paid us from its price only four din»Ìrs ;9. which you have paid to Ibn √¨Iy»Ìd b. √¨Awsajah. So when this letter of mine reaches you, pay ;10. to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨»Ìd its price and do not delay it. And obtain from him the quittance  ;11. for what you pa[i]d to him and do not delay that. For the judge has already ordered us to gather it and he has exacted it from us.  ;12. And take from √¨Abd All»Ìh only for the amount that you owe (us) until this letter of mine reaches you, ;13. and I receive all and give him a quittance for it. And if the load will not come from you so that we receive it, we will ask it from  ;14. √¨Ubayd. And I know, God willing, that you surely will not harm me in any way. ;15. And peace be upon you and GodÇ«÷s mercy. ;;Verso: ;From Muslim b. √¨Amr to  Ish»Ìq b. √¨At»ÌÇ«÷ the Ç«™

cu520 | 1 | In this letter from Muslim b. √¨Amr to Ish»Ìq b. √¨At»ÌÇ«÷ several unrelated commercial transactions involving also √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad are discussed. Ish»Ìq is to buy flax from √¨Abd All»Ìh with the money he owes Muslim, and to obtain a quittance for it. Ish»Ìq probably presented this letter to √¨Abd All»Ìh together with his payment which explains its presence in the latterÇ«÷s archive. ;The following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
