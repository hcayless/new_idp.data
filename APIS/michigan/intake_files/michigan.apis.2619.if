cu500_t | 1 | Apollonous to Terentianus, her brother, greetings and continual good health. I want you to know that since I wrote to you before about my affairs, now . . . that the full amount of the rent and the seed will surely be available. And do not worry about the children; they are in good health, and they are kept busy with a teacher. And about your fields, I have reduced your brother&apos;s rent to the extent of two artabai. Now I receive from him eight artabai of wheat and six artabai of vegetable seed. And do not worry about us and take care of yourself. I understood from Thermouthas that you obtained for yourself a pair of belts, and I was much gratified. And about the olive yards, they are quite productive so far. And the gods willing, if it is possible, come to us. I wish you to be in good health, and your children and all your kin salute you. Farewell.;Year 2 of the Emperor Caesar Nerva Trajan Augustus Germanicus, Phamenoth(?) 20.  . . . .;;(Verso) Deliver to Iulius Terentianus, soldier.
