cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus in its present condition survives in two large, detached fragments which join exactly in l. 9 of the printed text. It has suffered severe mutilation at the top and the text before the formula acknowledging receipt of the loan is almost completely missing. The right segment has also suffered serious damage, whereas the left side is preserved in a good condition. As is to be expected in this late period, the papyrus is written on charta transversa in which writing and kolleseis run in the same direction. Three kolleseis are extant, the first along line 2 of the printed text, the second along line 9 and the third - the most clearly marked - is located right at the foot of the papyrus. Each kollema measures ca. 14cm. The damage of the papyrus at the top must have been caused by the separation of the upper kollema(ta) from its original location along the joint. The number of the kollemata lost at the top cannot be established.
