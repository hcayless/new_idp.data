cu500_pal | 1 | A larger, cruder hand than that of P.Mich. III, 214. THe rather ungainly appearance of the script is caused in part by the fact that the writer found it necessary to dip his pen frequently and wrote heavy, black letters soon followed by lighter ones. Pen or ink or both, rather than the writer himself, may be held responsible for the lack of firmness and uniformity which mars the appearance.  (Winter) - The same (Christian) scribe as in P.Mich. III, 218-219 (Farid)

cu500_t | 1 | Paniskos to his wife and his daughter, many greetings. Before all else I pray before the lord god that I may receive you and my daughter in good health. Already I have written you a second letter that you might come to me, and you have not come. If, then, you do not wish to come, write me a reply. Bring my shield, the new one, and my helmet and five lances and the fittings of the tent. And you wrote to me: "I sent to Heraiskos(?) . . ." and I gave [a talent] to Antoninus, in order that he may pay it to you: so do not neglect . . . So if you have the materials for clothing bring and cut them here. I send many salutations to my daughter and to your mother and those who love us, by name. I pray for your welfare. Pauni 22.;(Postscript:) And you wrote to me that you took twenty[-three?] shields; Tammon, none of them. Temnas has stayed below. I salute you.;;(Verso);;Deliver to my wife, from Paniskos in the house of Par---.
