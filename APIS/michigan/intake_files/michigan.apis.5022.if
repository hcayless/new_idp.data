cu590_con | 1 | The recto of this light brown papyrus has the left margin. It is badly damaged at the middle and the fibers have been either frayed or removed. It seems that it was vertically folded twice. The upper part still folded; the lower side is mutilated. The verso side has the left, top and bottom margins. It is badly damaged at the right side as a result of a vertical fold; the fibers have been either removed or frayed at that side.
