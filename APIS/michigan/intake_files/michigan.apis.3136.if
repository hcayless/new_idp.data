cu500_pal | 1 | The text of this document is written in a small, rapid, but skilful and finely articulated hand. Scouring of the surface has removed or obscured the writing over some two centimeters up and down the right side of the sheet. The subscription, which begins in line 28, exhibits the large, heavy, awkward, poorly balanced letters characteristic of a bradeos graphon. (cf. Scriptiunculae II, pp. 640 f.). The document has been cancelled with a succession of oblique strokes drawn downward from left to right through the entire text.
