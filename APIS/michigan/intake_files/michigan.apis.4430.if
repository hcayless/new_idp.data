cu500_pal | 1 | Written in two hands along the fibers in black ink; first hand (lines 1 to 14 and signature) is neat and practiced; the letters are large-sized cursive and ligatured; some letters invade the interlinear space such as lambda, iota and rho, which sometimes extends into the following line or even invades the following interlinear space; the scribe started the word omologou with large and incomplete omicron that invades the interlinear space; the interlinear spaces are even of c.a. 0.8 cm. Second hand (lines 15 to 21) is fast and legible but less practiced; it used thinner nib and started its first line with huge looped alpha, which formed in lambda shape, invades the interlinear spaces in the diagonal stroke and the loop. The interlinear spaces are about half of first hand; some other letters invade the interlinear space such as psi, xi and rho. There is a blank space of c.a. 2.0 cm between the text and the signature. There is no punctuation or other diacritical marks.
