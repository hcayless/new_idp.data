cu500_pal | 1 | A section of the lower margin 2.3 cm deep, probably representing the original width, remains intack; and on the right the intercolumnar space is preserved to a width of 1.1 cm. The width of the column, measurable in ll. 10-14, which alone are complete, is about 9 c. The letter count per line is 22-26.  There are no accents, The original scribe wrote the diaeresis in l. 19.  High stops are used to mark sentence ends or mid-sentence breaks. The script is a practised and quite rounded book-hand of the general type commonly referred to as sloping oval. The line height (0.2 cm), the interlinear space (o.3 cm), and the sloping stance of the letters are quite consistently maintained. The scribe paid more than average attention to the evenness of the right margin; he inserted line-fillers.
