cu500_t | 1 | Areskousa to Herakles, her brother, greeting. You wrote me about the sow that I should sell it, or take it home, or provide the cost for its support. As a matter of fact, although I am willing to provide the cost, they submitted estimates that were not small, and I did not venture to commit myself to so great an expenditure without your decision. However, I gave them eight drachmai on account until you arrive and know what you have bargained for. By all means send me by this shipment twenty drachmai&apos;s worth of good cotton thread. See that you do not neglect it, since your brothers have no outer garments, now that their cotton ones are worn out, and they need them, as you know, inasmuch as they spend all their time in the field. Give my greeting individually to all your household. Charmos greets you, as do also Herakleides and Tanechotes and Sarapion and the little Seuthes and Tauris and Apollonarion and our whole family. Farewell.;;(Recto, 2nd text);;To Herakles, her brother, from Areskousa.
