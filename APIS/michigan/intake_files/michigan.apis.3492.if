It is effective against fistulous ulcers resulting from the surgical incision made in a lithotomy, and against  those ulcers resulting from multiple incisions in great length in operations for fractures. 1 oz. of pitch, 3 oz. each of wax and oesypum (grease of sheeps&apos;s wool), 6 oz. each of pig-fat  and bull-fat, 5 oz. of pine-resin. When it is for ulcers, use more of the medication; when it is for cicatrizing, less.     "
