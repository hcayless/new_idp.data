cu590_con | 1 | Medium brown papyrus of bad quality; broken off at all sides; it has no margins; damaged and it has many holes and lacunae at many parts as a result of, at least, seven vertical folds. Two of these folds have been sliced rather than torn, probably done by the dealer. There is a kollesis ca. 7 cm from the right edge. The surface is roughened, especially at the kollema at the right side.
