cu500_t | 1 | "Greeting, Chariton. Keep a sharp eye on the work that is being done by Heron, even though he is paying the workmen, and oversee the operation so that it gets done with precision and in orderly fashion. And notify the village officials, so that they will not harass him, i. e. Heron, because he is not working with them. And have a meeting with Philemon about the assistant of Gelasios (?) . . ."

cu520 | 1 | The writer of this private letter anticipates a clash of jurisdiction with local officials over a piece of work of an unspecified nature for which a certain Heron, presumably a contractor, is providing the laborers. He instructs Chariton to keep a close eye on the undertaking and at the same time to warn off the demosioi as lacking authority over Heron.

cu590_con | 1 | The lower half of the papyrus has suffered considerable damage, but a margin of 1.6 cm. remains at the bottom on the left side of the verso of the papyrus which has escaped serious damage. The damage suffered by the lower half of the papyrus does not interfere with the reconstruction of the text, except in the last line which has resisted any attempt to arrive at an adequate reading. The papyrus was folded twice vertically, once from the left, once from the right. The two folds are still plainly visible because the papyrus cracked along both of them.
