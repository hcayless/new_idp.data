cu500_t | 1 | To lady my mother Faustina, Allous, greetings in the Lord. Having chanced to use the letter-carrier I greet your motherly kindliness, my mother. Since it appears from your letter to me that it was [not] possible to come because of . . . [For the . . .] of my brother&apos;s orphaned children I, being a woman, cannot suffice. Therefore, if you have enough, send me via the letter-carrier two pounds of tow, so that I can spin and sell it for them. I greet you fondly. The little children greet you. I greet mother Kyriake. I pray for your good health.
