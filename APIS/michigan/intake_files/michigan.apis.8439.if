cu500_pal | 1 | The scribe used a double dot above iota and a single dot between phrases for punctuation. Phi is enlarged in the body of the text. The supralinear stroke is very short. The hand is a good even one of the type used in the ninth century, and similar to that of M566 and Cop. Lov. 2, cf. Lefort, Museon, 50 (1937), 5-7, pl. II; the letters, however, are a little more carefully made

cu590_con | 1 | Originally, this manuscript probably measured 26x 32 cm. The fragment preserves part of one column, probably the outer of two. The left side of the column of the verso is missing. As it stands, there are twenty-three lines, but to judge from the amount of verse 11 which is lacking between the recto and the verso about seven lines must be gone, including two lines at the bottom of the leaf that are completely illegible. The verso has twenty-six lines on which at least one letter can be distinguished. The right side of the column is missing. The verso is readable, although the ink has eaten out the vellum in places. On the recto, however, the vellum is worm-eaten, the ink has worn away, and the letters show through from the other side, so that hardly half of the letters are certain.
