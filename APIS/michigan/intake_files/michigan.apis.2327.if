cu500_pal | 1 | The ink was originally very dark brown, almost black, but it has largely faded to a light reddish brown and in some places is nearly the same color as the papyrus. The letters, written without ligature with a somewhat blunt pen, are typical of the Vth-VIth century. Alpha and delta often have a similar appearance. Both are sometimes open at the top, but the oblique of delta usually extends above or below the body of the letter, or both. Eta often extends above other letters; lambda usually has an elongated first stroke, and kappa an elongated final stroke. Abbreviations are effected with a diagonal stroke through the end of the last letter.;The text is written in two columns, and the impression arises that the papyrus was cut to its present size after the writing was completed. The margins are narrow all around; in both columns the initial letters of each line were begun successively farther to the right so that neither column has a straight margin. On the left side the papyrus was cut to follow the margin.
