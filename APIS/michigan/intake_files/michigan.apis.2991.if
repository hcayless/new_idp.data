cu500_lin | 1 | 1-173
cu500_pal | 1 | Written in a rather large and regular cursive. (TC) Both of the first two columns on the verso are only approximately half as wide as those on the recto, and consequently many of the entries in that column require two lines. Col. i is relatively short, a free space of 7.5 cm. is left below it. The second column is somewhat longer as the free space below it has been reduced to 5.5 cm. Col. iii is extreemely short, which may be explained by the completely different content. Finally, col. iv has measurements similar to those on the recto. The name-groups are divided by horizontal strokes. Checkmarks are used, not only for the figures in ll. 140 through 142, but also for single entries on both sides of the document.

cu518 | 1 | Ptolemais (Hormou), Herakleidou meris, Arsinoite nome, province of Egypt
cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains a list of names arranged by families, which suggests that the list was compiled from a census list. Some persons listed within certain name-group have no apparent relation to eachother; probably  these persons were grouped together because they shared a house. Lines 140-145 (verso, col. iii) contain 31 numbers, all in the region between 19 through 23. The total sum of these figures is then given in line 146. This construction follows a standard formula: A sum is given, then specified, and finally the single entries of the analysis are added up once again as a final check.

cu590_con | 1 | This medium- to dark brown papyrus is broken off at left and bottom; at the top and at the right is has been cut off rather regularly, especially at the right edge. Lots of damage such as holes, tears and folds. Several kollleseis. (TC) Originally, this document contained much more than the few columns that have been preserved for us today, because the figure 36 may be read above col. ii, which shows that 35 columns preceded this columns.
