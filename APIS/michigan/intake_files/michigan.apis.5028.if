cu500_pal | 1 | The papyrus was turned over vertically; written against the fibers, upside down with respect to the recto, in large sized cursive letters with ligatures; the hand is well formed. The interlinear spaces are almost even (of 1 cm). The delata is formed by drawing two separate strokes: an oblique curved stroke going towards left and attached to the following letter with a small hook at the right and a horizontal stroke with a hook facing up at the left side. The scribe used a horizontal stroke at the end of a word to represent an abbreviation.
