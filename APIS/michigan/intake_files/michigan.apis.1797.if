cu500_t | 1 | To Zenon greeting from Pyron. Though I desired some time ago to ask you for money for buying poppy seed, I have refrained until now, being ashamed to see so many others applying to you. So in order that, if you sail down to the Pentaeteris, I may accompany you in proper style, will you kindly help me at any rate to buy 150 artabai, which I will presently deliver to you in quantities of 30 artabai? I ask this not only for the sake of my private expenses, but also to meet expenditure on the papyrus rolls [- - -] Do this for me then at any rate. And please consider my request about a plot of land which I can sow and thus live decently &apos;without troubling&apos; you for the future, once you have provided this year&apos;s seed. May you prosper.
