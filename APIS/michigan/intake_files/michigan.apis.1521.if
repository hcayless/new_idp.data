cu500_pal | 1 | First hand (lines 1-12) are written in a cursive hand with a rightwards slant. Second hand (13-16) is very similar to the first hand and might have been written by the same person. The letters, however, are slightly smaller, and the ink is darker. A possible explanation is that the space available for the second receipt was shorter than that available for the first.
