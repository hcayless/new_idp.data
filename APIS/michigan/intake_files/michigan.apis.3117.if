cu500_pal | 1 | The text on this diptych is written in uncial letters, in roughly parallel columns which are at times separated by vertical lines and regularly divided by horizontal strokes to indicate the transition to new items or new dates.;The two leaves were turned back to back, i. e.with the wooden surfaces touching, the edges with the two pairs of holes being at the left. When all the space on the waxed surface of the upper tablet was filled, the writer turned the diptych over vertically and not horizontally, and began to write on the other waxed surface. The result was that, when the two waxed faces subsequently were folded together, the top of one leaf was opposite the bottom of the other, and the writing on one of them would appear upside down.

cu520 | 1 | The diptych contains a series of accounts which for the most port deal with a series of harvest operation-reaping an threshing-carried out between Pauni 2 and Epeiph 30.  In addition there three short entries, the relation of which to the foregoing is not clear. This was probably a day-book of an overseer, who kept thereon a detailed record of the daily work performed by the various laborers employed on the estates under his supervision. This record he would use as a memorandum for the calculation of the wages to be paid these workmen, and also for the compilation of a report of expenditures to be presented to his employer, the owner or lessee of the estates, cf. e. g. P. Lond. III1170 verso.

cu590_con | 1 | The leaves of this waxed diptych is of wood slightly hollowed out and coated with black wax on the inner sides. A large portion of the wax in the center of leaf 1 has crumbled away, probably owing to unfavorable atmospheric conditions, along the edge of the crack in the lower part of the leaf.
