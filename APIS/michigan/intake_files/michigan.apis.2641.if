cu500_t | 1 | To Ammonios Paternos, centurion, from Melas, son of Horion, of the village of Soknopaiou Nesos, a priest of the god who is in the village. There belongs to me and also to my cousins Phanesis and Harpagathes held in common and equally in the same village as an inheritance from our maternal grandfather a vacant plot surrounded with a wall where we stack our annual supply of hay. Now the one (cousin) Harpagathes died recently and although his share was inherited equally by both of us, yesterday, which was the 23rd, while I was stacking my hay in the place, Phanesis violently and shamelessly assaulted me and appropriated my hay not alloving me to stack it in our share (but) attempting to exclude me therefrom and to claim for himself alone what belongs to me; not only this but he also offered me the most brutal illtreatment. Wherefore I beseech you to command him to be summoned so that I may be able to obtain the just judgment which comes from you. Farewell. ;(2nd hand) The first year of Publius Helvius Pertinax Augustus, Pharmouthi 23.
