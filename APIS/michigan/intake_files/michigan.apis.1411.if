cu500_t | 1 | Paniskos to Protogenia, his wife, very many greetings. I would have you know that I have given a letter to Dioskoros, inasmuch as he was journeying from me, and now I am writing a second time that I did not give him the talent, but he is making payment. Accordingly, take the talent from his property. And I sent to you his check for the talent drawn on his account, that you may get it, as I said above. Hermeias, your brother, is in the country beyong with the prefect. We send him word repeatedly that he may come to the corrector Achilleus, and he has not come. Most of our nineteen colleagues have come to us. I salute you, Heliodora my daughter, and all our kinsfolk. Thoth 12.;;(Verso);;To Protogenia(?) [- - -]
