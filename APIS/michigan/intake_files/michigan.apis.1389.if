cu520 | 1 | Soueris, daughter of Onnophris, granddaughter of Labesis, mother Soueris, acting with her husband, Orseus, son of Tryphon, as her guardian, divides her property equally between her two sons, Onnophris and Tephersais. The property consists of a house inherited from her father, a share of another house and court that has been purchased, and household goods and clothing. The sons have the responsibility of providing a fitting funeral for their mother. To her daughter, Thermouthis, Soueris has left the sum of sixty drachmas, perhaps in addition to dowry already received. This is probably to be a charge on the estate after the mother&apos;s death. All the other terms of the agreement has been lost.
