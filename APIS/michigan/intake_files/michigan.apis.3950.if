cu500_pal | 1 | It preserves the lower left-hand section of a letter written in a fairly tidy hand resembling that of P.Stras. II 93 (214 B.C.). But for the more expansive kappas of the present papyrus, both papyri display nus with the final stroke rising above the line of writing, boxy mus and etas reminiscent of pis, and an omega with the second loop reduced to a flat stroke. The original length must have been considerably more extensive.  The text is written across the fibers.

cu520 | 1 | Of the document proper it is likely that formal greetings and, perhaps, reference to previous correspondence are missing at the beginning, while the blank space below the extant text suggests that it ended there, possiblywith the customary farewell formula and date written immediately below the concluding request. The fragmentary nature of the text permits only a partial appreciation of its contents. In what appears to be an administrative memorandum (or possibly a business letter), the sender apprises a peer (or a subordinate) of the dispatch of a shipping conductor [in order to avoid?] the delay or sequestration (presumably of grain) [and to ship?] the remainder of the commodity for which payment has been made (?); he concludes by requesting the addressee to attend to the loading.

cu590_con | 1 | The piece is marred by several holes and horizontal tears, none of which impairs the legibility of the text. Its four edges are cut along straight lines.
