cu500_t | 1 | The Emperor Caesar Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Augustus Arabicus Adiabenicus Parthicus Maximus and the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Augustus declare: Since many still petition to be freed from being forced, contrary to prior edicts, to pay levies of others as if on mutual security, we deem it necessary to reaffirm our previously proclaimed edict on this matter, viz. that no one is to be forced to pay levies of another ‚Çô neither a father for a son, nor a son for a father, nor anyone for anyone else ‚Çô nor substituted(?) for another under the claim of such collection. If anyone is revealed contemptuously collecting levies of another from anyone, he will suffer no ordinary danger. Posted in Alexandria, year 8, Mecheir [. .]
