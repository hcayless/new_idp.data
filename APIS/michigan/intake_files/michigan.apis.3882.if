cu500_pal | 1 | The letters are large well-made capitals, with serifs decorating the bottom ends of the vertical strokes. They are incised and inked and fill the lower half of the label. There is a high point after ny. It is a dot of ink placed slightly below the level of the upper tip of the right leg of ny, near the edge of the label. It is unlikely that it was intended as an abbreviation mark, as there was ample space above ny for the conventional short stroke, and I am unaware of any example of a dot following a letter to indicate abbreviation on Greek mummy labels or in documents.
