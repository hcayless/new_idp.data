cu500 | 1 | The passage giving the measurements (l. 3-6) is difficult to interpret, both because of the omitted measurements and because of the writer&apos;s lack of clearness in describing what must have been an irregular plot of ground. The interpretation in the translation is based on the assumption that Eutychos gives first the measurements of all the vacant lots, and then the measurements of the particular plot sold. This confusion is increased by the passage giving the neighbors (l. 6-12), which must be listed for all the vacant lots rather than for the portion sold.

The measurements of these lots are            ells from south to north throughout,        ells from west to east; on the north side from west to east thirty ells, from south to north seven ells on the west side, on the east side from south to north three and one-half ells from the eighteen and one-half ells of those ells designated from south to north, and from west to east on the south side thirty-eight ells.

And the other guarantee, given by us and by our dead brother Eutychos the second, for the other lots and house which Chrates and Herakles hold and which we sold to them previously shall remain valid for them as aforesaid. I, Eutychos, wrote also for my wife who is illiterate.;(2nd hand) We, Sisichales and Sisois the carpenter, the two sons of Eutychos, our mother being Thermouthis, acknowledge that we have joined in selling the aforesaid lots and in receiving the price and guaranteeing the sale with every guarantee; and our wives, that of Sisichales, Heraklous, daughter of Aunes, her mother being Tasouchion, and that of Sisois the carpenter, Thermouthis, daughter of Sigeris, her mother being Taorseus, consent to this sale and agree not to proceed against it forever and not to bring any claim, and that no one else shall in their behalf. And the other guarantee, given by us and by our other brother, who is dead, for the other lots and the house which Chrates and Herakles hold and which we sold to them previously shall remain valid for them as aforesaid.
