cu500_pal | 1 | The dark brown papyrus has been written in reddish brown ink, and small literary hand. The contents of this ephemeris are arranged in about fourteen columns. Single ruled lines separate the columns of figures, with double ruled lines at the bottom. Single lines are also ruled horizontally across the columns as guides, so as to separate the entries into groups of two or three. The three fragments came from a codex.

cu520 | 1 | Astronomical ephemeris for 467 A.D. covering parts of the first three months of the Egyptian year, Thoth, Phaophi and Hathyr. The numbering of the weeks, the Roman, Egyptian or Alexandrian, and lunar months; the daily position of the moon expressed by sign, degree, and minute, and the hour at which it passes from sign to sign; the daily position of the sun, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury; and designations of each day as a good, bad, or indifferent, doubtless based on astrological considerations such as the aspects of the heavenly bodies.
