cu500_pal | 1 | On palaeographical grounds I should be inclined to assign this piece to the sixth century A.D. The text is written in a large, grand, upright hand, which decreases in thickness by the beginning and apparently in size during the course of line 3. Line 4, from p(ara) on, is written still smaller and with greater slant, evidently by a different hand. The text shows some signs of elegance and has a generally attractive appearance. On the other hand, the writing at the ends of lines 4 and 5 becomes squeezed and cramped, and the text is further marred by a number of mistakes. Judgements as to the numbers of letters missing at the ends of lines 1-3 and 11-12 are exceedingly difficultowing to at least three factors alluded to above. The first hand is larger than the second hand; line 3 is written narrower than lines 1-2; the second hand, in lines 4-5, evidences a tendency toward cramping and squeezing at line ends.

cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains the top part of a petition addressed by Philoxenos possibly (far from certain) to the governor of the province of Arcadia. Surviving are (in part) the address (lines 1-4); a short proem (lines 5-8), virtually complete; and the beginning of the narrative of events leading up to the petition (lines 8-13).
