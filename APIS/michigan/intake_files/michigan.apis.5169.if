cu520 | 1 | Letter from √¨AliÇ«÷s mawl»Ì to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad pleading to reconsider his planned punishment of a fugitive. The fugitive had come to the sender who had obtained an am»Ìn for him from a certain Abu al-Munir. Under the threat of being punished by having his beard shaven off he was handed over to the sender of the letter, and his misdeeds were forgiven. The sender then circumcised him. Now the sender has been told that √¨Abd All»Ìh has ordered to put the fugitive to the sword and he asks that √¨Abd All»Ìh give the fugitive some papers of his own adding that he hopes the letter will benefit the fugitive. The sender ends his letter by sending greetings to √¨Abd All»ÌhÇ«÷s brother. The fugitive had personally reported to √¨Al»ÌÇ«÷s mawl»Ì about his threatened punishment by √¨Abd All»Ìh, making it likely that this letter was brought to √¨Abd All»Ìh by the fugitive himself in the way that many recommendation letters for the letter bearer were.;The following documents are addressed to the same recipient: PP.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5578(8).
