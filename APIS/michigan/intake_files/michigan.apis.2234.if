Now if this is the way (matters lie), you have done badly, badly. Do not take his camel driver then till he gives him (the equivalent of) everything which he has done for him. And if he agrees with him, if you like, take him away and come out to Antinoe. Bring the gold pieces which you took from Ambrose and those of the master Pinoute, the Chrysones.";(Verso): "Give it to Tiahkolos (?) X from the Comes."
