cu500 | 1 | See edition of the other side (N.Litinas): On one side three lines are preserved written in black carbon ink with a brush. The text is Demotic and was published by Spiegelberg (1930, 39) and republished by Zauzich (1987, 99-100). The translation is as follows: ‚Ç£Harsiesis the elder, son of Kolanthes, alias Se, priest, who died 67 (?) years old, who had lived in the 10th district‚Ç¥. The difficulty arises form the word mr(.t)-iwe.t, which was so far not found in Demotic and is comparable only with the Coptic ____, ____, which means district of a city. The name of the area is not named here, but it could be Pr-nb-wt, which is found in another Michigan label, inv. no 4535.10, line 2 and in P.Harkness, line 4, and it uncertain whether it is a name of a city or a necropolis.
