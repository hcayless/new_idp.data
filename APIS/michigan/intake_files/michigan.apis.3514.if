cu520 | 1 | For the probable content, see section on content of the electronic version of P. Mich. inv. 21 I. Lines 1-5 contain the remnants of the last five lines of a page of the codex, but they are so meager that we cannot be sure of a single word. Lines 6-10, written in the second hand, contain directions for mixing and for the use of a recipe. They probably pertain to the recipe immediately above in the body of the text, rather than to a recipe in the lower margin of the preceding page, which would also have been written by the second hand.
