cu520 | 1 | In this letter of which only the top half is preserved, N»Ìjid b. Muslim reports on a letter he received from the amir ordering him to forward to him some specific grapes. He therefore asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to send to the amir all the grapes that the villagers have brought him. He tells him to do something, possibly to provide the names of those he appointed to oversee the execution, presumably of the delivery of the grapes and of those he appointed to take care of the governorÇ«÷s business.;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
