cu590_con | 1 | These two pieces are badly damaged in many parts; they obviously have been sliced by a sharp tool; there is a small mark of slice attempting can be seen over the letter epsilon in ‚Ç£me‚Ç¥ at the end of line 5 from down. Broken off at left top and right sides. The lower margin is preserved in both of them; some small tiny fragments are attached to recto and verso of the two pieces. The area after the 5th line from the top at the first piece is totally frayed. A kollesis can be seen at the verso of the big piece.
