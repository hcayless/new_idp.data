cu500_pal | 1 | The papyrus is part of a codex.The recto shows a column from 7 to 8 cm long and about 13 cm wide. At the right of this, there is a portion of a column, from 4 to 5 cm wide, whose writing begins at a point fully a line higher than that of the left column. The upper margin of the fragment varies from 2 to not quite 3 cm. On the verso the narrower column begins similarly at a higher level (or nearly two lines) than the wide column. The title is 1 cm above the wide column of the verso. the writing is in a somewhat uncouth uncial about 3mm. high, and probably belongs to the third century A.D.
