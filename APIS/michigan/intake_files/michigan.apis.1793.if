cu500_t | 1 | Aleximachos to Zenon greeting. Nikanor who is handling you this letter is a friend of ours, and he has gone on a journey to your district on account of his son being one of the epigonoi who have received allotments in the Arsinoite province. Be kind enough then to show him consideration in any matter about which he may speak to you; for you will be doing a favour to me. And write to us yourself about anything that you may desire at any time. Farewell. Year 31, Hathyr 11.
