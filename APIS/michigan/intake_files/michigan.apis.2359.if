cu500_pal | 1 | The text is written in black ink. The hand, with letters 2 mm. high is quite small, square and slightly cursive. The text is well accented and contains breathings, tremata and stops. The very wide left margin (7.1 cm) contains, at about its horizontal center and opposite lines 12 and 13 of the text, the book&apos;s title: "iliados z". The title was written by a second hand, in larger letters (4 mm high), more upright and square, with lighter ink and a broader pen. The placement of the title and the excessive width of the margin may indicate that the text is the beginning of a roll. This cannot, however, be demonstrated; it is just as possible that a large, nearly column-wide space was left between the end of Book 5 and the beginning of Book 6; cf E.G. Turner, GMAW 16ff. and the texts cited there.

cu590_con | 1 | Dark, smooth papyrus. The text is probably the beginning of a column, although the upper margin, which would have been deep, is not preserved, and perhaps the beginning of a roll as well.
