cu520 | 1 | Letter from George the symmachos to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As>ad which opens with long blessings and greetings. The long honorifics used by the sender to address √¨Abd All»Ìh and the fact that the latterÇ«÷s name is mentioned first in the address contrary to common practice suggests that √¨Abd All»Ìh holds a higher social and administrative position than George. George asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to send him one din»Ìr as an advance payment (salaf) with the bearer of the present letter. He then tells √¨Abd All»Ìh to write Ab√— Daw√—d, who seems to have had something to do with GeorgeÇ«÷s appointment as symmachos. Finally, George asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to send him two boys with fruit because there is none available at the senderÇ«÷s.  Two people, one of whose names is lost, the other being Nadhir b. √¨Abd al-Rahm»Ìn, send their greetings to √¨Abd All»Ìh at the end of the letter. ;The following documents are addresed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
