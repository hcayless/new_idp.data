cu500_t | 1 | (Recto): "Before the discourse I greet in the Lord your Paternity, honored in every way. But I inform you that, if God will, may your mind be set at rest, for God has sent his blessings to us. See, eighteen hundred pots we have sent to the drying place aside from our expenses and the workmen. And see, a hundred score of fruit and four score of other (fruit) I have sent, and eight lilohe of grapes and eight lahe of strained wine. And be so good, if possible do not remain away from us, for your face and your discourse excel that of us all. Salvarion in the Lord!";(Verso a): "Give it to my dear, honored father X the great man. From Taurinos the least.";(Verso b): "This day, Hathyr 27, the most God-fearing brother Paul, of the service, gave me certain writings, which are those of your Paternity, in which you order, with signature, that I should take the sheep in the possession of the brother Shenouti, and give them to him.

cu520 | 1 | Taurinos writes to his "father" of his prosperity, evidenced by the great quantity of fruit and wine sent to the drying place, and invites him to come visit him. The drying place was used for drying fruit and fermenting wine. Verso b was written before verso a and has no apparent relation to it or to recto. It is probably the beginning of a long letter, to judge from the size of the characters, from which a small strip was torn for the reception of recto.
