cu500 | 1 | The papyrus 5622A was put in the folder 5622. But the "reference list" and the folder with the history of the papyrus did not mention it at all. Petra Sijpesteijn joined it with the inventory no 5613, for which the reference list entries"large fragments from several Arabic documents". (without stating how many). There is no folder with the history of this papyrus. Therefore, even though we keep the inv. 5622, we name it as 5622A, but the papyrus seems to be actually inv. 5613. Edition&apos;s Side A is Recto; Side B Verso according to APIS guidelines. oversize box.

cu520 | 1 | Jarid b. As√¨ad writes √¨Abd All»Ìh about the collection of jizya. As in letter 23 Jarid writes that the jizya should only be paid over the harvest and that √¨Abd All»Ìh should only start the tax collection once the harvest has taken place. He then tells √¨Abd All»Ìh to guard something, possibly the gathered taxes. Jarid urges √¨Abd All»Ìh to pay special attention to this matter, appointing someone he trusts and supervising it himself. ;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
