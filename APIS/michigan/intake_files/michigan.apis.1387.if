cu500_pal | 1 | The hand of the recto (A) is of a fair size, angular and slanting slightly to the right. It is bolder and less tentative than either of the two hands which wrote on the verso (B) the same text, but still not very skilful, as is shown by the different sizes of its letters and the uncertainty in their relative placing. The hand writes the title of this exercise, "diegemata", in middle of the space on the left. A third hand, an alphabetic hand like the second has written the same title some seven lines above the other title.

In it was Orestes&apos; son Tisamenos. Temenos the eldest of the Herakleidai said, in drawing up his army, that he would hand over the kingdom to that one of his sons who gained most distinction in the battle.

cu520 | 1 | The narrative deals with a battle between the sons of Herakles and the Peloponnesians. Before the battle Temenos, the eldest of the Herakleidai, offered the kingdom to that one of his sons who gained most distinction in it. Success in the battle fell to the Heraklidai, and Archelaos the eldest was adjudged the most distinguished.;The narrative seems to go back to a hypothesis of the Temenidai, because it displays a remarkable overlap with fr. 107 of P.Oxy. XXVII 2455. In addition to this overlap, Luppe points to the occurence of participles and other expressions. But there is a diffreence as well: the repetition of words does not agree with the usual style, cf. l. 3, 4-5, 8 and 9.
