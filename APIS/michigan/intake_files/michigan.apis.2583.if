cu500_t | 1 | Gemellus to Apollinarius, his most esteemed brother, greeting. Very many thanks to you, brother, for your care of me; your recommendation helped me greatly. And before that your very good friend Rullius, who knows the good will that you have for me, was concerned to make up for your absence; he introduced me without delay and with zeal to Aemilianus as a kinsman of you whom he cherished. And I ask, brother, that you make acknowledgment to Rufus if you write to him. I sent you the letters of Aemilianus and Rufus and Chariton. Write me how you are and what you want. Salute your entire household, together with whom do you also fare well, brother.;;(Verso) To Iulius Apollinarius, veteran, from Gemellus.
