cu518 | 1 | Tebtynis, Polemonos meris, Arsinoite nome, province of Egypt
cu520 | 1 | Recto, col. I, and Verso, col. I-XII, present accounts of expenditures made by Kronion and his colleague Eutychas, the officials of the record-office (grapheion) of Tebtynis, during the 6th year and the beginning of the 7th year of the Emperor Claudius. In view of their distribution on the papyrus and of their incompleteness, they were probably not compiled for inspection. - Verso, col. III runs from Jan. 29 to March 3, 46 A.D., with the last lines occupied by a special account of beer used in January.

I of the recto and col. XI-XII of the Verso was attached to the rest after these columns had been written.
