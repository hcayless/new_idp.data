cu300 | 1 | 1 papyrus ; 3.6 x 20.4 cm
cu500 | 1 | During the restoration of the papyrus we saw that a small piece of papyrus was stuck on the back (on the top  as we see the papyrus from the back, on both foldings), most probably when the papyrus was still folded in the ancient times. This piece had some red ink on the side it was stuck, so it was removed and then it is obvious that is comes from the right-hand side of the large piece (recto side). I assume that as the papyrus was folded from the left to the right, this comes from the third and fouth foldings. Now it is preserved only the first and the second foldings (long piece), and only the top from the the third and the  fourth foldings  (NL)
