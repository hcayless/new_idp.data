cu520 | 1 | Notification to the exactor of the Oxyrhynchite nome from the praefectus annonae Alexandrinae that two shipments of wheat from the nome had been brought to imperial storehouses in the vicinity of Alexandria and duly entered in the records there.  According to l. 24 the original letter of which this text is a copy, although addresses to the nome exactor, was turned over to one of the epimeletai who supervised the shipment as a receipt.  Nonetheless, the present papyrus plainly did not remain in the Alexandrian office.;In addition to the docket (26-27), the back contains two short accounts which have no connection with the main text. The first is dated to a fifth indiction, presumably A.D. 376/7. As a sample, l. 3, " from Kopreus and his brothers, on account of rent 31 1/2 art., on account of arrears 7 art., interest 2 1/3 art., together 40 5/6 art". From the second account, which follows in the same hand after a blank space of 6 cm: (l. 9) "of these 13 art. were brought up to the city by Kopreus on Mesore 25".
