V, 246). The spelling is interesting also from the confusion of vowel sounds which it exhibits. (Boak)

cu500_t | 1 | Personal.;;(2nd hand) Ptolemaios the younger, son of Akousilaos, to Kronion, son of Apion, nomographos of Tebtynis, greeting.;Since you prepared the documents for me in my sale to Pausis, son of Peteuris, of a half share and court and entrance and exit in Tebtynis, as I have already declared, formerly the property of the sons of Tisenxis, the son of Petesouchos (son of/alias?) Apoulas, (and) because you, Kronion, have prepared for me the documents for the correction of the public records, in order that no loss may ensue to the treasury I shall pay to the treasury the price which I received from Pausis. And I shall render you, both Kronion and Pausis, free from constraint and execution and annoyance in every way, since the sons of Tisenxis havedisappeared, where I do not know, because they were heavily indebted to the fiscus. And if anyone shall summon you or proceed against you in respect to these things, I myself will oppose his claim at my personal expense and cost. Let this handwriting be valid wherever produced. The thirteenth year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, the twenty-first of the month Sebastos.
