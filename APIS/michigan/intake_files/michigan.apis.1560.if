cu500_t | 1 | To Aurelius Horion, senator and archivist of the registry of real property of the Arsinoite nome (2nd hand) from Aurelia Tapais, daughter of Papnouthis and Thaisas, from the [village] of Philadelphia of the division of Herakleides, acting without a guardian in accordance with the customs of the Romans in virtue of the ius liberorum. I purchased (in accordance with a contract) drawn up here in the Arsinoite nome on the present day a building of one story, formerly a mill, in which there is a dilapidated yard, located in the same village of Philadelphia, at a price of three thousand drachmai of silver, equal [three thousand drachmai], from Aurelius Titus Valerius Gaianus, son of Titus Valerius Satrianus also called Serenus and of Iulia, Antinoite and however he is styled, not registered. Accordingly, I submit the application that a provisional entry be made in accordance with the copy of the contract of sale which I have deposited. For when I submit the declaration for this property, I shall show that it belongs to me and is unencumbered and unclaimed by anyone, but if the building should appear to belong to another or to be subject to a previous claim through the record office, there shall be no hindrance from the present entry.;(1st hand) Aurelius Horion, senator and archivist of the registry of real property of the Arsinoite nome . . .
