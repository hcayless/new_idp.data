cu518 | 1 | Meris of Herakleides, Arsinoite nome, province of Egypt
cu520 | 1 | This official correspondence records the following events (in reverse chronological order, as was usual): a. A former gymnasiarch in the Arsinoite nome and a group, of unknown size, of diakritai ektheseon of the division of Themistes of this nome submitted a petition (lines 15 ff.) to the strategos of the division of Themistes and Polemon, Aelius Numisianus, probably with regard to the activities of the sitologoi of the Themistes. The date is lost; b. On August 14, 140 A.D. (Mesore 21, third year of Antoninus Pius), Aelius Numisianus forwarded a copy of the petition to Apol(l)inarios, strategos of the meris of Herakleides of the Arsinoite nome, apparently requesting that he look into the matter (lines 8-14); c. Promptly, on the following day (Aug. 15), Apollinarios sent copies of the petition and covering letter to his royal scribe, Sarapion, instructing him to deal with the problem (lines 2-7).
