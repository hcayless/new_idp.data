cu520 | 1 | In this letter N»Ìjid b. Muslim writes √¨Abd All»Ì b. As√¨ad about the governorÇ«÷s (am√´r) request not to send √¨Abd All»Ì scribe to the capital. He further informs him of something Yaz√´d b. √¨Al√´, an official in the capital, told him about. Finally, N»Ìjid tells √¨Abd All»Ì to refer anticipated protesters who had been assigned a task which seems to have involved being sent to the capital, to N»ÌjidÇ«÷s letter. The letter is complete and an address is written on Verso. ;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).

cu590_con | 1 | Light brown papyrus written with a thin pen in black ink perpendicular to the fibers on Recto, parallel to the fibers on Verso. The original cutting lines are partially preserved on all four sides. The left bottom corner is broken off resulting in the loss of seven to nine letters in the seven bottom lines. The right bottom corner is broken off but has caused no damage to the text. There are some holes in the papyrus due to wear which have resulted in some damage to the text.
