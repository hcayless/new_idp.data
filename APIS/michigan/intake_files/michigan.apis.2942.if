No man (in the) world shall be able to come to you on account of it. If we withdraw ourselves from you so as not to, we will give so much refined silver (and) so much other refined silver (for) the burnt offerings (and) the libations of the king, may he live forever! Written by Herais his wife, daughter of Orsenouphis, his (sic) mother being Arete(?), the wife of Mersis, saying, "I am present (and) I write, my heart is satisfied therewith. Take(?) this courtyard and the room and this storehouse. He that shall come unto you on account of it, bearing my share, I will cause him to be far from you, of necessity, without delay." Written by Kronion, son of . . ., the document scribe of Tebtynis. Written by Marepsemis, (son of) Marepsemis, who is called Chresimos. Written.;;(Greek) I, Mersis, also called Pyrrhos, son of Labesis, acknowledge that I have sold to Eutychos the elder, son of Eutychos, the vacant lot that belongs to me, in which there are a building and storehouses and all the appurtenances, in Tebtynis; the measurements of all of which are from south to north, seven cubits, from west to east, twenty-six and one-half cubits, to the extent of the total measurements in cubits, as many as there may be. The neighbors are on the south the court of Herodes, son of Herodes also called Isidoros, and in part the lots of the purchaser Eutychos, on the north the Hermaion, temple of the great god,a nd in part an open space of the same temple, on the west the royal road, and on the east the lots of Mersis himself. And I have received the entire price agreed upon for them, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee from public and private debts and every impost as aforesaid. Marepsemis, son of Marepsemis, wrote for him because he is illiterate. The wife of Mersis, Herais, daughter of Orsenouphis, her mother being Arete(?), consents to the sale, and agrees that she will not proceed against it forever, or bring any claim, and that no one else shall do so in her behalf forever as aforesaid . . .
