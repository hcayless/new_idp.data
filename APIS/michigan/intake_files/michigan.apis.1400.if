cu500_t | 1 | Col. i: ". . . and no one knew whether the house was mine or yours because there was no disagreement between me and you. But now I am being subjected to violence by your very own Ptolema, who sent me word to this effect: "Give up the house. Otherwise, your household furnishings will be put out." I ought not to have been subjected to these things. For I have assurances (from you) for the period from the Amesysia to the Amesysia, and the god willing I owe you nothing on the rents except for the present semester only. I pray for your good health."

cu520 | 1 | This side of the papyrus contains the remains of two private letters, each of which occupied a column of writing. In Col. i the writer  complains with some bitterness that he is being threatened with eviction from a house which he holds in lease from his correspondent, and this despite the perfect harmony that has characterized their relations to the present time. The letter in Col. ii is very fragmentary, but it appears to repeat in some measure at least the protest voiced  in Col. i concerning the eviction from the house mentioned therein.
