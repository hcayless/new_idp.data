cu500_pal | 1 | For a general description of the palaeography, see electronic version of 21 a-m. Right margin of approximately 5 cm. Line 1-3 is in the hand of the scribe and ll. 4-8 in that of the owner. The text in the second hand here maintained the same margin as that of the text in the first hand. No paragraphos is visible between the two texts, nor was there a space left between them. The five lines occupy only only 2.5 cm. of the normal 4 cm. of the lower margin, and since they seem to be filled almost entirely with ailments, at least two or three more lines are needed to complete the recipe.

cu520 | 1 | Lines 1-3 contain the last three lines of a page of the codex. For the probable content, see section on content of the electronic version of P. Mich. inv. 21 I. In l. 4 the word synkoptikois may be restored, suggesting that the second recipe might have been concerned with synkope, a sudden loss of strength.
