cu590_con | 1 | This light-brown papyrus is damaged on three sides; only the right margin remains intact. Although the upper margin is badly damaged, it appears to be the beginning of the document. Especially the damage on the left side of the papyrus, where it may be estimated that ca. 27 letters have been lost in the beginning of each line. Four vertical folds still visible.
