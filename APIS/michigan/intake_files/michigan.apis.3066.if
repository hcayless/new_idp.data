cu500_t | 1 | (Col. I);;[- - - This] name [is] a favor charm, a charm to dissolve a spell, a phylactery, and a victory charm: "AA EMPTOKOM BASYM, protect me.";;Charm of Hecate Ereschigal against fear of punishment (in the underworld): If he (a punishment daimon) comes forth, say to him: "I am Ereschigal, the one holding her thumbs, and not even one evil can befall her.";If however he comes close to you, take hold of your right heel  and recite the following: "Ereschigal, virgin, bitch, serpent, wreath, key, herald&apos;s wand, golden sandal of the Lady of Tartaros." And you will avert him.;"ASKEI KATASKEI ERON OREON IOR MEGA SAMNYER BAUI (3 times) PHOBANTIA SEMNE, I have been initiated, and I went down into the [underground] chamber of the Dactyls, and I saw the other things down below, virgin, bitch, and all the rest." Say it at the crossroad, and turn around and flee, because it is at those places that she appears. Saying it late at night, about what you wish, it will reveal it in your sleep; and if you are led away to death, say it while scattering seeds of sesame, and it will save you.;"PHORBA PHORBA BRIMO AZZIEBYA". Take bran of first quality and sandal-wood and vinegar of the sharpest sort and mold a cake. And write the name of so-and-so upon it, and inscribe it in such a way that you speak over it into the light the name of Hecate, and this: "Take away his sleep from such-and-such a person", and he will be sleepless and worried.;;Against fear and to dissolve spells: Speak through [two] knives [sounding loudly] this formula: but [against] evil animals it does not work [compellingly], for [- - -];;(Col. II too fragmentary to be translated)
