cu500_pal | 1 | Like the language of the document itself, the hand of this papyrus is clear and understandable, but lacking in grace. The letters vary in thickness and color, apparently accentuating the points at which the writer returned his pen for more ink. Usually four to six letters in a series are markedly darker and thicker; these are followed by three to five lighter letters, followed again by the darker series. The writing rhythm is moreor less regular throughout the six lines of text. For similar though more skilful hands, see Schubart, Griechische Palaeographie, Abb. 17 = BGU 1282, or Schubart, P. Gr. Berol. 21b = P. London 177, p. 168 = Mitteis, Chres. 57; nevertheless the writer of this document shares many characteristics with these two more professional and more quickly written hands.

cu520 | 1 | The text is a receipt for partial payment issued by Nikephoros, agent for Alexander, to Pasoknopaios, partner of Harphaesis. A payment of four artabas of grain is acknowledged against a total debt of nine and one-half artabas. The debt, although now repaid in grain, was apparently computed according to the price of wine, and hence the transaction recorded seems to have been an exchange of wine and grain.
