cu500_pal | 1 | The document is written in a very clear and professional cursive. (TC) Thus, the hand is well written and entirely litterate. At least one column must have preceded it and one must have followed it, but beyond that there is no clue to the extent of the original account.;Since the hand is the same throughout and since the two dated entries are separated by more than a year, it is clear that this is not a current account, but that it must have been compiled for some special purpose. Perhaps it was a record of arrears in business to be used as a basis for acquiring possession of the pawned items that had not been redeemed.
