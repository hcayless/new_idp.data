cu500_pal | 1 | The long lower margin suggests that this fragment comes from the bottom of a column. Part of the right margin is extant.  It is written in a broad, gently sloping uncial hand. The type is common in literary papyri from the second century A.D. onward. Parallels place the text in the late second or early third century: cf. P.Oxy. I 26, III 446 and 447 (all late 2nd cent.), and P.Oxy VI 946 (late 2nd/early 3rd). Compared with these examples, the writing on the Michigan fragment is more compact, but the shape of the letters is very similar, especially to those in P.Oxy. 26 and 946. Rough breathing and accents are indicated, but the scribe did not add a grave on the eta in line 409.

cu590_con | 1 | The writing is parallel to the fibers. This papyrus is one of the fragments listed in R.A. Pack, The Greek and latin Literary Texts from Graeco-Roman Egypt, no 565. It was briefly mentioned by A.E.R. Boak in Aegyptus 4 (1923), p. 38, where it was said to contain Iliad 3.408-422. Evidently the papyrus has since suffered damage, for it now has only lines 408-419
