Thedocument is completely preserved, but it has now been divided into four parts: one horizontal tear has split the document in the middle, resulting in the loss of most of l. 17; a vertical tear along one of the folds in the left side has caused the detachment of two smaller pieces, resulting in the loss of minor sections of text in the left side through the entire document.
