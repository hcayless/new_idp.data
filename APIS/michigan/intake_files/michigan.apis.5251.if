cu590_con | 1 | Brown thick and coarse papyrus of poor quality; regularly cut at the left, right and bottom; the top is irregularly cut rather than broken. The papyrus has the four margins. It seems that the papyrus was folded few horizontal times and one vertical that caused damage at several places. The text is complete (3 lines).
