cu520 | 1 | The entry is composed of personal name followed by an amount of silver. The first column of the recto has 22 lines or entries and the second column also has 22 lines, but lines 3 and 4 are lost due to the break in the papyrus, as well as most of lines 1 and 2.  The verso is also a palimpsest. The original column is earsed mainly under the new column which is upside down in relation to the old. The old column has traces of 22 lines remaining. The new column has 12 lines consisting of name plus number. The old column apparently was an account as well.
