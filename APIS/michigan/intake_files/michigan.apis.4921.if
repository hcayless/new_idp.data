cu500_pal | 1 | The recto and verso for (A) and (B) are written by the same person. The hand is experient and clear the letters are of medium-sized cursive with the tendency to be ligatured; as the usual type of the tax listing these two documents have many abbreviations. There is a check mark before every name in the recto of both (A) and (B), yet there is no such mark in verso for both of them. Is also a semi-circle mark around one of the amounts in the first column. Papyrus (B) has preserved the number of one column ‚Ç£200‚Ç¥ on recto. Two big patches of ink are in papyrus (B): on the recto over the column‚ÇÖs number (199), and on the first column on the verso. There is a wide blank area (about 7 cm before the first column on verso of (B) which make us wonder if it is the 1st column!

cu590_con | 1 | Papyrus (A) is a dark brown color and has no margins. It is broken off at the middle of the first column. It is also badly damaged at many parts: the middle of the second column and at the beginning of the third column. Many holes and lacunae are attested. There is one Kollesis at the middle of the second column. Papyrus (B) has the same color and of the same quality of (A); yet it is in a better condition and has the top margin. The papyrus was folded at least 4 times that caused minor damages. There are also some holes that did not affect the text very much. One Kollesis is attested at the middle of the second column.
