cu520 | 1 | In this letter N»Ìjid replies to a letter from √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad about a water shortage in the town of Narmuda. N»Ìjid b. Muslim writes that he has sent Juzayy and R»Ìshid, two Ç«£water-managersÇ«• (s»Ìhibay al-m»ÌÇ«÷), and that he has ordered them to allow the inhabitants of Narmuda enough water for their personal use and for the irrigation of their fields. He adds that he has informed the administrator of another village that relied on the same source for its water supply, of his decision. N»Ìjid ends the letter by demanding from √¨Abd All»Ìh to complete all that lies in his responsibility and to do so in a trustworthy manner. ;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5626(C); 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
