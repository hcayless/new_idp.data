cu500_t | 1 | "Before everything I make obeisance to your Lordship. See, the installement, I have sent it north to your Lordship. Demand it then of Apa Stephanos, the chartulary, and may God bless you. Concerning Clarus: He took the harvests from (?) my places and left them fallow, since they were under judgment. Let your Lordship order him that he send his man south, and that the field be given back to me; for the place lies fallow, and the tax is in default (? and devolves ?) upon me. Salvation in the Lord."
