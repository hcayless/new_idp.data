cu500_pal | 1 | The hand is regular, pointed capital, of medium size and of sloping type. It is bilinear and the preserved portion shows no ligatures. The shape of omega is remarkable, because the left part is rectangular and the right is slightly curved. Also, the entire base of the letter, made of two almost horizontal strokes, sits flat on the line. Alpha is angular. Epsilon, omicron, sigma are almost of the same breadth. The hand could be assigned to the third century A.D.; cf. Seider II, nos. 32 33; for similar omegas see ibid., no 46.;The scribe wrote a dot at the end of vv. 290 and 295, which may constitute incorrect scribal punctuation. The dots are written with the same ink as the text and they could be also considered as a stray point of the pen. There is a diaeresis mark in v. 295. There is a dot above the second epsilon of meteisi in v. 298; it may or ay not be a cancellation mark by the fist or a later scribe. In v. 291 a grave accent is placed on the unaccented penultimate syllable of o]aristun to indicate that a high pitch follows next; see Turner-Parsons, GMAW, 15, 16, 20, 21, 27; J. Moore-Blunt, ‚Ç£Problems of Accentuation in Greek Papyri,‚Ç¥ QUCC 29 (1978) 141. In vv. 292 and 298 two acute accents are placed correctly in an ink that is lighter I color; they were likely added later by the same or a different hand.
