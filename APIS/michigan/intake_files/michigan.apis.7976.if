cu500_pal | 1 | This portion seems to have had been part of a roll. The first hand, which wrote the preserved line in the first column and lines 2-3 and 4-5 of the second column, was professional and formed some neat ligatures, for instance, in l. 1 and l. 4. This hand wrote entries of about 2 lines (c. 2 cm in height) and left a blank space between them, c. 1.5 cm in height. ;The second hand wrote in the blank space left deliberately below each entry. It was cursive and wrote in small-sized letters some standard abbreviations. The scribe marked the text as distinct from the entries, by writing in eisthesis and by encircling it.;The hand is comparable to that of SB XIV 11656, dated in A.D. 186-187, and the Michigan papyrus can be dated to the same period; in particular cf. some letters and ligatures, e.g. in ll. 17-21 of the Yale text. A proposed reading in l. 4 is the year 6 of an emperor (see n. ad loc.); at the end of the second century A.D. this year could be only A.D. 197-198 (Septimius Severus and Caracalla). The inspection could had taken place in the same or the following year

cu520 | 1 | Both entries begin with ‚Ç£and in the temple of Isis‚Ç¥. Then, the first letters of the following words, which are preserved partially (in l. 2 and in l. 5), seem to be epithets of Isis. The genitive of the noun ‚Ç£of the village‚Ç¥ in ll. 3 and 6 is another common detail in both entries. Therefore, at the end of l. 5 an expression of place (cf. l. 3 ‚Ç£to the east‚Ç¥) is expected. At the end of the entries (ll. 3 and 6) the tree(s) planted in these temples are mentioned (cf. l. 6 mulberry-tree(s)).;There is a reference to a register or survey of trees and the papyrus-sheet of a tomos synkollesimos, as the resolved abbreviation (sheet )points out. The ink in the text that follows (especially in l. 4) is damaged.;Registers of tress are mentioned in P.Vind.Pher. 161 (Pheretnouis; A.D. 196-197) and P.Congr. XV 15, 41 (Karanis; A.D. 80). These registers were drawn up by the village scribes (for their practice see P.Congr. XV 15, introd., p. 76). Also, three documents (SB XIV 11654, 11655 and 11656), published by G.M. ParÈíssoglou, ‚Ç£On Idios Logos and Fallen Trees‚Ç¥, APF 24/25 (1976), pp. 91-99, preserve detailed records of measurements of fallen trees; in particular, the latter one is a set of entries on trees and branches fallen on temple grounds. These trees were considered as without a private owner and were a concern of idios logos (see ParÈíssoglou, loc. cit., p. 93). It is true the entries of the Michigan papyrus record trees in temple groves (ll. 2 and 5) but these entries are a kind of shortened references or of abstracts of detailed descriptions and totally different that the ones of the papyri mentioned above. Also, the surviving text does not provide further information on whether it is about trees fallen upon the ground or just mulberry- and other trees still cultivated in the temples. It is plausible that the papyrus might have served as the draft during the schedule or itinerary for the inspection of some trees in the temple. In that case the responsible officials might have checked on spot the present copy up on the complete register or survey of trees (probably on a _____ _____ of one of the previous years) and have written down the reference to the sheet of the tomos synkollesimos, if something had changed or not since the last inspection. Later all the new information should had to be copied and reported officially in a new register.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is broken off at the top, the left- and the right-hand sides. From the left column of the text only the three last letters of a line are preserved. The amount lost at the right part of the second column is uncertain. The space between the columns is c. 3 cm in width. At the bottom the space left blank is c. 4 cm in height. The back is blank.
