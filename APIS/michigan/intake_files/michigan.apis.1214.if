cu520 | 1 | A receipt made by a woman named Athenarion, acting with her guardian, a cousin whose name is lost (l. 6), to a certain Philippos for payment of a large sum of money which we read (l. 21) as 3500 drachmai. Because of the large sum involved and the appearance of "klerou" (l. 13) we conclude that the transaction dealt with the sale of a rather large plot of agricultural land.
