cu500_pal | 1 | The Homily of Melito occupies the latter part of the papyrus codex containing the last chapters of Enoch, eight leaves of which belong to the collection Chester beatty, six to the University of Michigan.  Of the 14 leaves, the first five and the first page and a half of the sixth, contain what remains of the concluding chapters of Enoch; the last half page of leaf 6 and all the remaining eight are occupied by the Homily on the Passion. The holimy was so near its end, at the point where our last leaf breaks off, that its conclusion and title could have been contained in the few lines that have been lost from the lower part of the leaf. ;Below a table of the leaves, as it stands:;Abbreviations used: V(ertically) running fibers; H(orizontally) running fibers;B(eatty Collection); M(ichigan). In the Beatty collection each leaf has its own number. In the University of Michigan Library, the two Enoch leaves bear the number 5552, the four of Melito, 5553.;Leaf 1; pg 15-16 V-H B 100;Leaf 2; pg 17-18 V-H B 170;Leaf 3; pg 19-20 V-H M 5552;Leaf 4; pg 21-22 V-H B 169;Leaf 5; pg 23-24 V-H B 169;Leaf 6; pg 25-26 V-H B 167;Leaf 7; pg 27-28 V-H M 5553;Leaf 8; pg 29-30 H-V B 168;Leaf 9; pg 31-32 H-V M 5553;Leaf 10; pg 33-34 H-V M 5553;Leaf 11; pg 35-36 H-V B 171;Leaf 12; pg 37-38 H-V B 173;Leaf 13; pg 39-40 H-V M 5553;Leaf 14; pg 41-42 H-V B 172;The original height of the leaves was about 27 cm, which has been reduced by damage at the tops and bottoms to an average of 23 cm, and the width was 13.5 cm or slightly more. The column of writing was almost 23 cm in height, and its width varies from 10 to almost 12 cm.  On the right-hand pages the scribe usually made a wider column than on the left-hand pages, probably feeling freer to encroach upon an outer margin than upon the inner, because it would be harder to mread the text near the fold of the book. But there is great irregularity in the number of letters in the lines. The scribe sometimes  crowds them, especially toward the ends of the lines, sometimes makes them broad and sweeping. As few as 24 letters may be written in a line of ordinary length, while the number may run to 33 or 34. Lines of 28 to 30 letters are common.;The Homily is written throughtout by a single scribe, the same that wrote the earlier parts of the mansucript, namely, the end of Enoch, and the apocryphal fragments. The corrections, which are few and affect only single letters or syllables, were made by the original writer. The uncial letter is clear and legible, but crude. The writer was not a practised scribe.nHis deficiencies show themselves in the imperfect alignment of the lettrs, and still more in the wide variety in their size and spacing. Thre are cursive forms and no ligatures except that iota following epsilon is sometimes begun from the tip of the horizontal stroke of epsilon; in such cases it is continued farther below the base line than usual.  Alpha is sometimes hard bto distinguish from lamda, because of the neglect or careless placing of the cross-stroke. Beta is awkwardly formed; in some examples the two loops do not meet on the upright stroke, but leave an interval between them. Omicron varies from moderate size to very small.The loop of rho is so small that the letter is easily mistaken for iota, from which it sometimes differs only in descending a little farther below the base-line. Omega is usually of the flat type with a slight wave in the base, a form common in the third century. The numerals are written in a rather sweeping cursive by a hand different from that of the text, but not necessarily later.  Some mistakes show that the scribe copied from a manuscript in which mu and eta were more alike than in ours. Nomina sacra with the usual abbreviations. Final nu occuring at the end of a line is several times represented by a stroke over the preceding vowel.  For two major pauses, spaces are left blank and special paragraph signs are used. Elision is indicated by an apostrophe only once, although it takes place several times. There is a consistent effort to avoid hiatus. There are no accents, no breathings and no adscript iotas. the diaeresis is usually, but not always, placed above initial iota and upsilon. Internally over the upsilon of "Mwuses", over the iota of "Hsaias", and strangely enough over the iota of the dative "Mwusei". The nu movable is regularly used.
