cu500_pal | 1 | The hand is a small and very irregular cursive, which creates a major uncertainty estimating the number of letters missing in the holes of the papyrus. In the upper half of the text the ink is badly abraded, at places lost completely. In lines 27 and 28 the letters are so cramped together  that the character of the hand is noticeably changed, although there is no doubt that the hand in these lines is the same as that of the previous lines.To the left there is a free margin of 1-2 cm., and above line one there is a margin of 2 cm. Between lines 1-2 there is a free space of 1 cm. (TC)

Furthernore, it has also been written in the settlement, which I attach, concerning my son Aristeas, who is still a baby, that he remains with me but acquires clothing and provisions from Aristeas: I am now prevented [to enjoy my rights of the settlement], since I cannot use Arsiteas as my guardian, because I have divorced him, since my son is a minor, since I do not have other children, and I simply do not have any other [male] relatives. Therefore I beg of You, that the legal guardian will be appointed . . . ."

cu590_con | 1 | This medium- to dark brown papyrus was reguarly cut at all sides. The damages to the sheet give it a more rugged appearance at the corners and in the top left middle section. (TC) A kollesis running through the middle of the sheet is the cause of a hole which increases from the middle towards the top of the sheet.
