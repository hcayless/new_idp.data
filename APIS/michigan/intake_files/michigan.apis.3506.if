cu500_pal | 1 | For a general description of the palaeography, see electronic version of 21 a-m. In l. 4 a new recipe begins. The scribe did not indent this line or leave a space before it, but between ll. 3 - 4 he did separate the new recipe from the preceding with a paragraphos  connected to two marks of parenthesis in the margin. Another unusual palaeographical feature of this page is a sign located in the margin of ll. 8-9, repeated twice in the margins of 21m, 5-6 and 7-8. This sign is a vertical double-curved line with a horizontal stroke in the middle, appears to indicate that  the physician-owner is giving his own experience with the recipe in ll. 7-9. Another special feature is the familiar symbol for chrestos, "good", "useful", "effective" in l. 10 immediately followed by the unusual symbol consisting of two + +, of which the second is slightly above the line. This symbol, which might be another way to indicate the beginning of a new recipe, might be a stylized representation of lambda with an abbreviation mark = l(ambane), l(abe) = Lat. R(ecipe), "take".
