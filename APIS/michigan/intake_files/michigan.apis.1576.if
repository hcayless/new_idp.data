cu500_pal | 1 | Written in rather large and regular hand which is generally easy to read. At a later date, the verso was utilized for another letter, addressed to a propol(iteuomenos). The hand is small and crabbed, but a more serious, almost fatal obstacle to transcription is the fading of the entire text and the effacement of large portions by abrasions.

Herakleides&apos; heir is staying with us, and we have met with him a number of times to discuss the matters that concern . . . and him . . . wherefore I was not able to forward . . . And I say to you on my oath that even in sending you this letter I am of two minds lest it still not find you in Alexandria. Accordingly, when you receive my letter write to me about your plans so that I may may be able to forward something to you. Write also to the little one that she should ask from me without hesitation whatever she may need, as is she were getting it from you. Your mother-in-law Felicla and all those at home salute you.
