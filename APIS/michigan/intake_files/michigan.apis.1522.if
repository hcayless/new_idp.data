cu500_pal | 1 | The sheet originally held two complete copies of the document, each occupying a full column. The upper portion of both copies has been lost; the left side of the first copy, to a depth of ca. 6 cm., has been stripped away; the second has a width of 14.2 cm. Although the bottom of the sheet is considerably damaged, it nevertheless exhibits a margin of 2.5 cm., while a margin of 1.5 cm. remains along the upper half of the right side. The intercolumnar space varies from 2.5 cm. at the top to 1.5 cm. at the bottom. Both copies were written by the same hand.

Let this chirograph, written in duplicate, be valid wherever it is produced, as if it had been deposited in a public archive. And whenever he wishes, let him declare the arouras that belong to him to the bureau of property registration. The thirty-second year of Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Caesar, our lord, Tybi 3."

cu590_con | 1 | This medium-brown papyrus is rather regularly cut off at all sides. Some damage remains along the edges of the sheet along with some abrasions in the middle of the sheet. Numerous vertical folds are still visible as is akollesis 1.3 cm. from the right edge. Noticeably thicker than a standard papyrus sheet, and it appears that there are indeed at least three layers of papyrus. (TC)
