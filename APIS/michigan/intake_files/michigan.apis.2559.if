cu500_t | 1 | Apollinarius to Sempronius, his most esteemed brother, greeting. When I reached Rome I learned that you had departed from there before I came, and I was deeply distressed because I did not see you. But now I beg you to let me know how you are, since I am anxious. For inasmuch as I have not yet to this moment . . . I have sent our man Eros. I ask you therefore to assist him so that through you he may reach home safely. For I gave him 25 . . . to deliver. If you have the opportunity, give him an escort for the delivery . . . .;(12 more lines, severely mutilated)
