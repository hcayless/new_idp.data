cu590_con | 1 | Although this bright brown papyrus is broken off at the top and the left and fibers are frayed, the margins of all sides are preserved.   It is damaged in several places as a result of 5 perpendicularly folds. 4 big lacunae are located at the end of the folds. 2 kollesis almost at the middle. There are also small fragments are attached on recto and verso need to be removed. The one small fragment located at the lower part to the middle has the number 29 ‚Ç£kabba theta‚Ç¥ and another illegible abbreviation. Some fibers here and there need to be unfolded and aligned.
