cu590_con | 1 | Almost a square piece of papyrus broken off at the right hand side.  The papyrus was folded from down upwards 2 times. On the back, after the papyrus was folded to be sent, the scribe wrote parallel to the fibers the address. Also, there are some strips of papyrus cut from another document and are glued at the damaged and broken foldings to restore the papyrus. It cannot be ascertained when that procedure took place.
