cu520 | 1 | The text consists of a list of clothing and household goods, occupying all of the recto and almost two-thirds of the verso. That it formed part of the records of a pawnshop may be deduced from the occurrence of the words enechyreimai: "I have received as pledge . . ." There is no valuation of the individual items and no mention of interest. The only sum of money mentioned is at the bottom of the recto, and the amount, 20 or 30 drachmas, is much too small to represent the loan on the security of the items that precede it, or even the interest.
