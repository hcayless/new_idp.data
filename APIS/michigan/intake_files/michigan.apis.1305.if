cu500_t | 1 | "Dorotheos to my lord and in all respects truly most beloved brother John. When I heard, my lord, the things pertaining to Aphyngios I was not a little perplexed, and then I had this fear for a long time. Therefore, my lord, only your presence can repair my reputation and restore us to the same state with the aid of your perfection. For what has happened to me has occurred before. Indeed, many report to me the very same incident. But by the power of God who guides me we will take heart. And even if we have nothing of our own, at least that which belongs to others remains.

cu520 | 1 | What exactly the letter is about remains unclear. Dorotheos is evidently in deep trouble and hopes that John will extricate him. However, his concrete problem, as well as the cause thereof, is concealed by a string of complimentary formulas and generalities. In ll. 10-11 the writer finally seems on the verge of divulging the details, but at this point the papyrus unfortunately breaks off. All that is left is the bare mention of a sum of twenty solidi.
