cu500_pal | 1 | Irregular upright semicursive hand. Eta is of the h-shape, with a rather tall first stroke. The horizontal forms a sharp angle with the last stroke, which descends from it in a ponounced curve and then turns up towards the right. A similar curve is used in the last stroke of pi. Upsilon branches widely, and does not extend below the line; in one instance it is quite small and its stem curves up sharply to the right. Omicron is of medium size, with the breadth exceeding the height. Sigma is nearly closed, and the top is usually flat; in two places the flat top is prolonged to fill out unused space. In one case (l. 6) sigma is a narrow downward facing curve like an inverted U. A single sign, a short horizontal stroke, seems to serve several purposes. In l. 3 it does duty as an acute accent, in l. 4 as a smooth breathing or perhaps a grave accent, and in the other five places where it occurs it is the rough breathing. A similar vague use of a horizontal stroke is to be found in the Berlin cursive papyrus of Genesis. In l. 7 and 2 a point on the base line is apparently used to separate concrrent vowels. It might be regarded as a minor punctuation in the first instance, but in the second no pause is possible. The original height of the column is somewhat doubtful (c. 28 lines?) There is nothing to indicate the original length of the manuscript.

cu500_t | 1 | So he who gives is innocent, for as he received from the Lord a service to perform, he has sincerely performed it, without distinguishing to hom to give or not to give.So this service, sincerely performed, becomes glorious in the sight of God. So he who renders it sincerely will live to God. So keep this command, as I have told you, so that your repentance and that of your family may be found sincere, and your heart clean and stainless. Mand. III. And again he said to me.;III,2. - - - ] For they received from him a spirit free from deceit. If they give this back a lying one, they have defiled the Lord&apos;s command and become defrauders of him.
