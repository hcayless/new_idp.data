cu520 | 1 | Date: Persian period, regnal year 20, third month of summer, day 29. If this refers to reight of Darius I, then it is 501 B.C. The document is a letter. One fragment mentions payment of one deben (hd 1) with the name of Djedhor wrirren after that. It also mentions a Nesmin. A person named Osiris-ten, son of Nespare (the same figure in 3526a) is also mentioned in line x+8. Line X+5 has "Do not cause to curse the [...] of Nesmin". Scribe: probably the addressor. The addressor and the Addressee of the letter are missing, though perhaps the same parties as in 3526a. One line in the verso contains the end of the date begun on the recto.

cu561 | 1 | Unknown, perhaps Upper Egypt, part of the same papyri that included 3525a-c from Edfu
cu590_con | 1 | The placement of the upper fragments is uncertain because the text is so damaged that it cannot be checked to see if the fibers carry over. There are also numerous extremely small unmounted blank fragments (<1 x 1 cm) remaining in the folder.
