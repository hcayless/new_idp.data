cu590_con | 1 | There are holes in the center and the middle lines 1-5 are missing as well as part of the end of lines 2-5. There are a number of small fragmnets still in the foder. two fragmnets were pealed off the back having early Demotic writing, but they do not seem to fit any of the other papyri. Perhaps they belong to other documents. The two fragments are written on the recto (shown by the horizontal fibers) and 3526a is written on the verso (vertical fibers).
