cu500_pal | 1 | Written along the fibers in medium-sized cursive letters; the hand is fast and practiced. The, mostly, bold letters give us the impression that scribe was frequently dipping his pen into the inkwell while writing this document. Beta is shaped by two separate loops; very regular lambda; the tau is T-shaped; epsilon- is formed by drawing an oblique stroke going downwards to a curved stroke; rho is always extend below the line and sometimes invade interlinear space; it mostly ended with a curved stroke. Verso is blank

The text is washed out in some parts, partly rubbed in other; the main body of the text at the middle is mostly survived. There is a kollesis of 3.0 cm at the right side.  The papyrus is vertically folded three times about 4.5 cm from the left edge; it is generally suffered holes, removed or frayed fibers at several parts.
