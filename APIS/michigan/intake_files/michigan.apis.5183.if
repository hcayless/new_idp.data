cu590_con | 1 | This papyrus is in a bed condition; regularly cut at the left side and it preserves the left margin. Badly damaged and torn at the top and right sides. Although it is broken off at the bottom, it seems that it has lower margin. The text is almost lost at the middle; fibers are either or removed, frayed. The papyrus was folded vertically at least three times.
