The hand is fast and different to that wrote recto; Triangular sharp delta with an elongated the right stroke. Both sigma and epsilon have the same appearance, as a c-shaped, except for the elongated tongue of sigma that attached to the lower part; the scribe used an oblique stroke as an abbreviation. The end of the text is a list of numbers and unknown signs?
