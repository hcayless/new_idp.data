cu500_t | 1 | To Zenon greeting from Kallippos. Have you fallen asleep, regardless of me in prison? Think of your flocks and herds. Know that if the goats of Demetrios remain here, they will perish; for the road down which he drives them to the pastures is enough to kill them. Think too about the hay already cut in Senary, that it be not lost; for not small is the profit you will gain from it; I reckon there will be as many as 3,000 sheaves. I pray and beseech you, be not unmindful of me in prison. Much loss have I suffered since I was led to gaol from the allotment which I leased, trusting in your support. No little loss have you suffered since I was led to gaol; and the sheep which I have acquired since I came to you have been carried off by the shepherds since I was led to gaol. And if it seems good to you, I will leave my wife in prison to be answerable for me, until you require into the matters about which they accuse me. May you prosper.
