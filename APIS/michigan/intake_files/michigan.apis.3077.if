cu500_pal | 1 | The document is a chirograph, written throughout in the hand of the person who makes the acknowledgement. The script used on the papyrus is decidedly amateurish. The letters are large but look drawn rather than written. The writer experienced difficulty  in imposing a uniform shape on individual letters and was unable, despite obvious effort, to maintain a straight line. He was, however, not without pretension to elegance. Above the text is a magnificently broad margin of 3.8 cm., and a right margin 1.5 - 2.3 cm. has been painstakingly plotted.
