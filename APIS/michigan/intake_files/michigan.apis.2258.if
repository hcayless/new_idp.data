cu500_t | 1 | Epeiph . . .;Valerius Gemellus to Valerius . . . , very many greetings. Before all else, I pray [for your health] and make obeisance for you unceasingly in the presence of the hair at Koptos. I ask [you to write to me], and the gods ask the same thing of you. Even if I do not know . . ., you ought to grant me [this one favor]. In response to my entreaty, brother, be reconciled with me so that I may [enjoy] your confidence [also while I am in] service. Besides, [you have not even regarded me] as befits a brother, have you now, from the time that I left home? But [I regard you, in the manner] of a pious brother, as I do Sarapis. Above all, there is [no other] hope like the candid intercourse of brothers and one&apos;s own people. Do not fail to inform [me concerning] your well-being, and do persuade mother. (2nd hand) [Please] write to me as I asked you. I pray [for your health].;Before all else, I give thanks to my lady sister Thermoutharion in the presence of the gods, and . . . your well-being. Salute . . . .
