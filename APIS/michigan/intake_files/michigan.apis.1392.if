cu500_t | 1 | "To the police of the village of Theadelphia from Patron, son of Maron, from the metropolis. On the night preceding the first day of the present month of Pauni in the present <fourth> year, it was reported to me by relatives that a certain Chairemon, son of Asklepiades, a wool carder, scaled the wall and entered the house of Areios which adjoins mine . . . being watchful lest somewhat later on some malicious action be committed by him because of the fact that our house is united with the house of Areios. Wherefore I submit this petition so that this may be made clear to you and he give security lest something be done by him later on.;Year four of Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Augustus  Pauni . . .

cu590_con | 1 | This papyrus is medium brown in color and the ink is clear and dark. The papyrus was folded in half horizontally and then three times vertically from right to left, forming eight equal panels. These folds account for the loss of all the upper left margin and for the poor state of preservation of the text at lines 12-24.
