cu500_pal | 1 | Recto is written along the fibers in medium-sized cursive in black ink with ligatures; practiced business hand; the preserved text is consists of three columns with almost even intercolumniations and interlinear spaces. It seems that verso is written in the same hand with different pen; the interlinear spaces are inconsistent, they are larger at the top from the bottom; the upper and lower margin are preserved; there are no stichometry, paragraphos or other diacritical marks on both recto and verso.
