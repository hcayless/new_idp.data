cu500_t | 1 | To Protarchos, the epimeletes, from Menches, the goldsmith of the Oxyrhynchites in the division of Polemon. After Ptolemaios, tax farmer of the goldsmiths&apos; tax for the nome, found me in Krokodilopolis and made accusations against me (although I owed nothing to the king) and took with him as a helper Menelaos, a police officer, and they led me off and treated me violently and took away from me the silver lump that I had under contract and the necklace, for which things the weight is 108 drachmai, for which the documents will be attached, I appeared against them before Asklepiades, your agent, and they agreed and said they would return the things, but as of this hour they have not given them back. And since I am being harassed by the owner of the silver I am not able to leave town but am being destroyed since I am idle. Therefore, in order that I be able to pay the taxes owed to the royal bank in full, I ask and beseech you to send for them and to force them to give back the silver to me. For, when this is accomplished, I, who participate in the tax farming operations of the state, will not be done injustice, but will have received help. Farewell.
