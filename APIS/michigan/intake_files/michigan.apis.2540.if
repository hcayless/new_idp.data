cu500_t | 1 | Sabinianus to Apollinarius, his brother and lord, very many greetings. Daily I myself offer prayers for your well-being in the presence of the local gods, that you may be preserved for many years. You provide and have provided more than enough for our sister, and for this I acknowledge all thanks to you in the presence of all the gods; for it has been attested to me both by our sister and mother. I have written to you often, and the negligence of those who carry the letters has slandered us as negligent. So that she may surely take me as her guardian, I beg you to give heed to our sister in whatever she may ask to you. I salute the most worthy Abaskantos and all of your household, each by name. I pray for your good health as well as that of your entire household. Mecheir 18.;;(Verso) To Iulius Apollinarius from Sabinianus, brother of Apollinarius
