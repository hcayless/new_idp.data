cu500_pal | 1 | The writing is cursive but clear and fairly large, similar to that of R. Seider, Palaeographie der griechischen Papyri, I, 1, Stuttgart 1967, no. 46, pl. 28; the ink is clear. From l. 10 the ink is beginning to fade and the hand appears more hurried and less regular. The margin on the left is 1.5 cm.; the upper part and lower parts of the papyrus are also damaged, but they both have blank spaces of approximately 1 cm., which is more than the space between the individual lines.

cu590_con | 1 | This light brown papyrus is damaged by numerous holes. The right part of the text has been lost throughout the entire text, but the repetitive nature of the formula allows us to restore large parts of the lacunas and the lost sections. Free margins show that the text is complete on all other sides of the papyrus.
