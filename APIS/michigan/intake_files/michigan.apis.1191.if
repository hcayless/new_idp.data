cu520 | 1 | An account of payments in kind expressed in gomoi or "loads", a measure used frequently for chaff, but found also with other products, e. g. wheat, hay, dates, anise, and wood. Since the payment recorded in line 7 follows immediately on a statement of areas, and chaff assessments are known to have been been based on the aroura, the account may very well be concerned with collections of chaff. And if line 5 has been interpreted correctly, the entire account is probably devoted to dues collected from the priestly corporation of a temple.
