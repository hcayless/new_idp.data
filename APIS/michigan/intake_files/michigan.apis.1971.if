cu500_pal | 1 | The text is written in a medium-sized and somewhat irregular cursive hand. The letters are mostly unconnected. At the top a blank space of 3.3 cm. has been left free, and at the bottom a blank space of 4.6 cm. The end of the text on the recto is marked by a horizontal stroke stretching across the entire width of the papyrus sheet. The letter zeta is placed well below this horizontal stroke. This letter is in a larger hand than the text and of a somewhat different type, but not necessarily the work of a different scribe. The docket on the verso is also running parallel to the fibers.

cu520 | 1 | This document provides the proof that Diogenes had indeed been enrolled into the epheboi, namely the tribe Sosikosmios and the deme Athaieus. The docket on the verso strongly suggests that the certificate on the recto was requested by their son Julius to prove his own eligibility to this privileged class within the Alexandrian and Egyptian society.
