cu520 | 1 | Contract guaranteeing immunity, whereby Herakleides, son of Herakleides the younger, agrees to protect Kronion, son of Apion, the notary of Tebtynis, against any penalties he may incur for having issued to him without the proper warrant a contract of cession prepared for his late father; Kronion had refused to issue this document because of the father&apos;s failure to produce the necessary authorization from the bureau of catoecic registry. P.Mich. XI, 621, is a note to Kronion by the former owner of the land, Herodes alias Herakleides, confirming the same cession of land, already in 37 A.D.
