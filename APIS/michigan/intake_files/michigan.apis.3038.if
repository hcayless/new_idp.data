cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains a prosangelma, reporting a crime to the police personified by Nicanor, a police officer. The text gives a concise and accurate report of the time and circumstances of the transgression, of the loss incurred and of the estimated damage. The question of the identity of the criminals is not debated, nor is there any call for a court settlement of the matter.
