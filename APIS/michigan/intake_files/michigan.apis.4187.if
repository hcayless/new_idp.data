cu520 | 1 | This letter written by the weaver and tailor Kalim seems to be a response to an inquiry from √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad concerning the progress of some ordered work. Kalim informs √¨Abd All»Ìh that he has completed the weaving of all ordered veils except one. If √¨Abd All»Ìh likes, he should send Kalim one din»Ìr worth of riy»Ìt textiles to use in the production of the veils. If not he should let Kalim know and the latter will send him the veils as well as some other textiles he has completed. At the end of the letter Kalim conveys greetings from a certain √¨Aysha.;The following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
