cu500_pal | 1 | Written in large, clearly inexperienced capitals which are barely connected. (TC) The similarity of the crude handwriting to that of P. Lond. I 18 verso of 161 B.C. suggests that the fifth regnal year in which this papyrus was written is that of Philometor, 176 B.C., or that of the joint reign of Philometor and Euergetes II, 165 B.C.
