cu500_t | 1 | Before the discourse I greet and do obeisance to you with all my soul, together with the brothers who are with me. I have received your honoured letter and felt great joy because I have learned from it of your health. As regards your having written to me concerning the folder crops, that Abraham should water them, I sent to him and spoke with him so that he might respond. He said: "I will irrigate them and water them with my animals, and for the wage which everybody receives per aroura in our fields, I am going to remit half of it to you". For the man who brought me the letter said "We have two donkeys". Abraham said to me: "I am going to remit half of the wage", in order that my property shall not be held and my crops be dry. And when you want him to water them, he will irrigate for you as he said, for half of the wage. And the animals will irrigate in my property, and we will [not permit (?)] my crops to be destroyed, as he said. But what is most needful is that Christ protect you and your honoured sons and rightly bring their father to you and hear our prayer for you, that you and your sons may be satisfied with the place. Farewell in the Lord, my piet.;Address: Give it to my beloved daughter, the honoured and pious, Lady Timothea, from Petros the least.

cu520 | 1 | Petros, writing to Timothea, touches upon irrigation and related topics and includes quotations from a man named Abraham, who will offer assistance. Although the drift of the letter is plain enough, the writer does not mark the transition from Abraham&apos;s words to his own.
