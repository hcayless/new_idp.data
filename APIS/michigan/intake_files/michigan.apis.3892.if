cu500_pal | 1 | Together with the darkened wood, the very cursive appearance of the hand makes it practically impossible to reach a satisfactory transcription of this label. One side of the label has two lines of Greek, while the other has three, and there is no apparent connection between them. Beyond the first line of each side the letters are furthermore almost obliterated completely.

cu590_con | 1 | By now, the wood of this label has darkened, which contributes to making a satisfactory transcription of the label very difficult to accomplish. It has the usual shape of a mummy-label:  a rectangle with the two corners of one end pared off to form a more or less blunt point, near which is a hole. (TC)
