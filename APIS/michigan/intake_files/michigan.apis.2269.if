cu500_t | 1 | [- - -] gave us . . . . They brought your letter about what is happening in the village by reason of the break in the dam. Do you then also write to Zoilos that he may send Ammonios at once for the harvesting of the olives since they are being stolen from you because you are not free to keep an eye on things there and they are being stolen by the passers-by. If you find no way of delivering the message, as you told him, be sure to keep yourself in the public view(?). And when do you wish Nurse to come to you?;(2nd hand) Farewell.
