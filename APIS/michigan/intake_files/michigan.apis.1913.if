cu500_t | 1 | Eumelos to Ammonios, his most honoured friend, many greetings. Before everything else I pray that you are in good health and I make obeisance for you before the lord Sarapis. I have heard from Katoites that you say: ‚Ç£The administrator annoys me very much concerning the place Apasan, since he did not provide an account although the mother of Dioskoros was present together with him.‚Ç¥ Do not heed him! If we have done anything we have done it conformably to usage. I have written to him too and take care of the house. Stay healthy . . . . and take care of yourself. I salute by name all those of your family. Dioskoros and Sarapias and their mother salute you. Stay well. We salute Kanis and his wife and their children.;(Verso) Deliver to my friend(?) Ammonios [- - -]
