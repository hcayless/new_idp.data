cu520 | 1 | In addition to the docket (26-27), the back contains two short accounts which have no connection with the main text. The first is dated to a fifth indiction, presumably A.D. 376/7. As a sample, l. 3, " from Kopreus and his brothers, on account of rent 31 1/2 art., on account of arrears 7 art., interest 2 1/3 art., together 40 5/6 art". From the second account, which follows in the same hand after a blank space of 6 cm: (l. 9) "of these 13 art. were brought up to the city by Kopreus on Mesore 25".
