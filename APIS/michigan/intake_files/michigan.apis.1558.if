cu500_pal | 1 | The document has been written by two hands. The first hand writing the main text is rapid and practised and produces a semi-cursive, but legible, script; the second script is very similar to the first. The margins, both at the top and the bottom, are very small; the left margin measures ca. 2.5 cm. The bottom edge is markedly irregular, whereas on the right there is no actual margin, as the writing runs to the very edge of line 2. There is internal word-division in the first line in order to fill in the blank space after the address and for the same purpose the scribe uses the horizontal upper stroke of the sigma in Theodoros as filler stroke. The last line is slightly indented.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is written on a long rectangular piece of good quality regularly cut off at all sides. There are at least ten vertical creases. The space between the succeeding creases becomes gradually wider from the left to the right, corresponding to the way the papyrus was once rolled and consqently flattened.
