cu500 | 1 | The in-house data base entries this inv. no as: 19 very small Greek fragments of various periods. One fragment is Arabic. Faces copied from genuine documents? Found in wrapper with the coptic book (no 1289 = Lot no III.18). Actually in the folder there were more 25 fragments, probably broken from the initial number of fragments. Nikos Litinas, who catalogued them, recognized fragments from three documents and made joinings wherever it was possible.  Thus, now1396a consists of 9 fragments. 1396b of 1 fragment and 1396c of tiny 5 fragments. The so-called Arabic is part of 1397a document and demotic and there are no fakes.
