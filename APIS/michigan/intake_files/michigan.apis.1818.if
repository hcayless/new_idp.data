cu500_t | 1 | (Recto);;Apollonios to Zenon. When you were staying here [I warned you that] in a very short time we should have no lay left for the horses, and now [I find it necessary] to write to you about this matter. In order then that the horses may not [suffer through want] of provender, will you kindly take steps at once [to have hay sent to us]? For it is not easy to buy it in town on account [of the old stock being exhausted] and the new crop scanty; otherwise we would have done so. [Know that we] have not enough hay for a single day; so if you do not take thought at once, the horses will be falling ill. [Farewell].;;(Verso);;To Zenon.;(Docket, 2nd hand) Apollonios about hay for the horses. (Received) year 29, Daisios 28, in Arsinoe of Dion.
