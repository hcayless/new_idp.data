cu590_con | 1 | This dark brown papyrus consists of three fragments. First one has the left margin; it lost a small portion in the left side to the top. It is horizontally minor damaged at several parts as a result of a few folds. Second fragment has the top margin. Regularly cut at the right side, there is also a regular cut running from down to couple centimeters before the top, probably by the dealer. There is a Kollesis at the middle, as well as there are few lacunae at the right side. It is obviously that it was folded vertically at least twice. Third fragment is small and it is regularly cut at the left and right sides; the left cut matches with the middle cut in fragment 2. There is a vertical damage at the middle as a result of a vertical fold.
