cu500_pal | 1 | The hand is small, well-practiced and semi-cursive with some ligature, a typical late second century documentary hand. The subscriptions, less cursive and compact than the rest of the text, are written by less practiced hands. The text is written in black ink. The left (0.7 cm. - 1.2 cm.) and bottom (6 cm. - 9 cm.) margins are preserved, and the top line of the extant text is almost certainly the first full line of the original, although a brief address to the strategos may have existed one line above. The lettering averages 3 mm. in height with an average interlineation of 3 mm.

cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains the copy of a deed of sale. The buyer, . . .noitarion alias Thermouthion, has submitted to the archidicastes, Diodotos, a copy of the deed of sale of twenty-eight and a half arouras of land, including vineyards, plus a half-share of a water-wheel, which she purchased from Theogenes for 17,100 drachmas. The archidicastes has, in turn, submitted copies of the original contractand her request for publication to the Libraries of Hadrian and of the Nanaion; he has also returned to her a copy of the document as published, with his approval appended. She then sent a copy to the strategos with a request that he serve it on Theogenes. The text which we have is the copy which Theogenes received, since it bears his and a clerk&apos;s subscriptions acknowledging the serving of the document.
