cu590_con | 1 | This papyrus has lost a significant amount of papyrus to the left. The physical appearance of this document allows us to divde it horizontally into three sections: the top third of the papyrus containing no text has lost half of the papyrus. The middle third has lost practically no papyrus. The lower third is the most badly damaged of the three section, into which this papyrus may be divided. It has lost almost two-third of the papyrus, causing the loss of the majority of the text in this section and rendering the text too fragmentary for any interpretation.
