cu500_t | 1 | From minutes of Rutilius Achilleus, epistrategos. The second year of Lucius Septimius Severus Pertinax, Pachon 30. Gaius Iulius Ptolemaios appeared before the court, and Iulianus the advocate said, Ç«£This man is an Antinoite. When he became the victim of force and violence and extortion he petitioned you against Chairemon, son of Maron. Since the latter is not present, though you summoned him through your assistant, Ptolemaios, we ask, in accordance with <the> rights of Antinoites(?), which you also have confirmed, that he be sent to Antinooupolis for trial.Ç«• Achilleus said, Ç«£From what place is the defendant?Ç«• He replied, Ç«£From the village of Karanis in this nome.Ç«• Achilleus said, Ç«£Let the strategos order that the defendant be sent to Antinooupolis.Ç«•
