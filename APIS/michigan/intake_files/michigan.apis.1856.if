cu500_t | 1 | (Recto);;Nikobios to Maimachos greeting. I have written below for you a copy of the letter from Diotimos. Be good enough then to write us a statement about the corn and the sesame, showing how much you have measured in towards [the amount agreed on with] him(?), in order that we may send him word in accordance with what he writes. Farewell. Year 33, Thoth 2.;Diotimos to Nikobios greeting. Seeing that from the time of our departure the nomarchs have been doing nothing right in the measuring of the sesame and the corn, as soon as you receive this letter, if they do not immediately measure out the proper quantity, spare no effort; you will get it measured out if you give personal attention to each locality and compel them. Farewell. Year 33, Mesore 8.;;(Verso);;To Maimachos.
