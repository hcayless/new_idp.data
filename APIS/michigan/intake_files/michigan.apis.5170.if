cu590_con | 1 | Four fragments of a middle brown papyrus. The original cutting lines have been preserved at the top of the largest fragment only. In spite of the damage to the text not more than a word or part of a word on each side has been lost. The text on the three fragments does not follow directly but the three pieces are definitely related as is indicated by the script and texture of the papyrus. Two smaller holes at the top of the top fragment have not damaged the text.
