cu500_pal | 1 | This text is written by three experienced writers. The first hand contributed ll. 1-9 which contains the date, the place, and the word omologei ("swears"). The second hand wrote the body of the contract, using a finer-pointed pen and a more cursive style of writing. The subscription at the end of the text, written by a hypographeus for the seller, is in a hand considerably more rapid and extremely cursive.
