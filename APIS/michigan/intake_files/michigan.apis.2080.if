cu520 | 1 | The purpose of this account can no longer be established. At the end of some lines are what appears to be proper names, written smaller than the preceding material (perhaps by another hand) and mostly abbreviated. It is possible that the amounts listed before the names were received from or paid to these persons (it cannot be said with certainty whether Mena in l. 5 is nominative, genitive or dative).
