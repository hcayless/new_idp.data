cu500_pal | 1 | The papyrus comes from a carefully and professionally written roll of pleasing appearance. The writing is in a medium-sized, well-rounded but somewhat flattened book hand which shows considerable skill and experience on the part of the scribe. The stance of the letters, nearly upright and in some cases sloping slightly to the left, presents a quite uniform impression. Ornamentation in the form of loops or finials is present at the extremities of many letters.  No marks of punctuation are visible, but a space the width of one letter has been left in I 11 to mark the major break in a long sentence. Similar spaces may have been used at the beginning of new sentences or sections; such a break in II 7 has at any rate been marked by a paragraphus, apparently in the ink of the resulted from the scribe&apos;s over-zealousness. Additionally, no paragraphus stands at II 16 to correspond to the modern section break there. There are no breathings, accents, or similar marks, although a diaereses, possibly  added after the text was written, is present on initial iota in II 6. Line height and interlinear space are both about 0.25 cm, and the column width probably averaged about 7.3 cm.
