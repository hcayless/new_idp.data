cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus has the left, top and the bottom margins. This papyrus is badly damaged in several places. It is damaged at the left side, just before the text, probably as a result of a fold. A big portion is lost at the middle. The fibers are frayed and need to be unfolded. Generally it is in a bad condition and a restoration needs to be done. (MA)
