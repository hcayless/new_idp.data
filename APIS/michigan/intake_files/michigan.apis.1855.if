cu500_pal | 1 | The writing is semicursive, the letters are large and the hand is very similar to that of Schubart, P. Gr. Berol. 33; this resemblance allows us to place this text chronologically together with P. Col. inv. 320 (SB V 7662). Apart from other similarities among those two texts, they both feature some prominent orthographic characteristics. In the beginnings of both texts, which contain the formulaic sections, both scribes are very accurate in the orthography, but in the drafting of the real letter the iotacisms and the substitutions of vowels become very frequent as a testimony to a predominantly phonetic writing. Free margins at the top and to the left.;The address on the back is written in a calligraphic hand similar to that of Schubart, P. Gr. Berol. 35 (cf. also P. Mich.VIII 489; 496; 504).

cu520 | 1 | Certain words in this letters suggest that the letter was dealing with persons within a Roman military circle. Ignatios writes to Apolinarios and Alammon, and the letter appears to be concerned with shipment of some objects.

cu590_con | 1 | This bright yellow papyrus is broken off completely at the bottom and partly at the right, although this only becomes relevant from line 7. In this same line the papyrus a horizontal split in the papyrus has caused a misplacement of the fibers and at ca. 8 cm. from the left margin, approximately from the kai in line 7, and as a result the lower part of the letters is slightly misplaced to the left of the upper part of the letter, thus rendering the reading very uncertain.
