cu520 | 1 | Homer, Odyssey 11.577-610 (om. 590, 604). In general the text follows the vulgate. Its divergences are paralleled from other sources, and both omitted lines are missing from a number of other examples of Odussey 11.;579 deitr[on: read "dhtron"; vulg. "dertron". The Michigan reading, with emended spelling, is paralleled in one MS (Parisiensis 2680). The vulgate is the only possible reading of the three found in the MSS. The third is "deltron"; cf. OCT, app. crit., ad loc.;582: "kra]ter: rec. "chalep". The Michigan reading is vulgate and is supported by a substandial majority of the MSS; cf. OCT, app. crit., ad loc. Writing the vulagte here makes the line =593 except for the object of the verb. There is no real choise between the two readings. Didymus (sch. min.) in the lemma reads "kratera";586: possin" the nu-movable is unnecessary.;588: dendrea  th": vulg. "dendrea d". The Michigan reading is supported by a number of MSS (cf. OCT, app. crit. ad loc.) as well as by P.Fay. 310. But "de" is necessary to introduce the new sentence.;590 om. The line was omitted in one MS (Venetus 456) but added in margine with an indication that it should be read after 588. It is easy to see how the line might have been omitted; it is superfluous. Lines 586-590 = 8. 114-115; if the omission of 590 is valid, its inclusion in many MSS may have been cause by reminiscence of 8.114-115;591 "ei[thusei: read "ithusei";592 reip]taske: read "riptaske. The width of the lacuna (about 6 letters) makes it necessary to assume etacism here.;604 om. The line has a history of omission. It is missing from a number of MSS (cf. OCT, app. cirt., ad loc.) as well as from P.Fay. 310. Line 604, along with 602 and 603, was athetized by Aristarchus, and it was said to have been interopolated by Onomakritos (schl. H). Line 604 = Hes. Theof. 952.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is very fine, light colored.;1202, fr. a: letters from the middle parts of 585-595 (om. 590; a stripped and illegible area above 585 is tall enough to have once contained 582-584); no margins;1202, fr. b: letters from the beinnings of 595-610 (om 604); lower margin 1.5 cm.;1203: letters from the beginnings of 577-595 (om. 5900; upper margin 2.2 cm; left margin 1.4 cm;1209 fr a: letters from the middle parts of 577-578; upper margin 1.6 cm;1209, fr. b: letters from the ends of 577-582; upper margin 1.6 cm; right margin 1.2 cm;1209, fr. c: the bottoms of 3 letters from 582; the lower portion of this scrap is stripped and illegible; were it legible, it would probably contain a few letters from the end of 583.;1209 fr. d: letters from the ends of 580-593 (om. 590);1209 fr. e: letters from the middle parts of 584-594 (om. 590)
