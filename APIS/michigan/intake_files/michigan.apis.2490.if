cu500_t | 1 | " Recto:;(She adorned) the garment with pearls.;;3. My mother is the church, and the pearls are the true words of God. The robe is the Holy Spirit.;;4. And she sent me to some cities which are dark, there being storms there, and neither sun . . . in them, nor moon nor stars.;;5. And I came to the first city, the one which is called Anethais Labyrinthos. And I found in that place some ass-centaurs and serpents, and a throng of demons, who wished to kill (me);;Verso;me. 6. I came to Babylon on the river which is called Sandy, the one on which no one is able to make his way except on the Sabbath. For it keeps the Sabbath itself, this river, in the manner of the synagogues of the Jews.;;7. But I, with the power of the Holy Spirit, crossed the river on the fifth day, and there was in that place the great dragon. He came from the east, with his tail forming a circle around him and reaching his mouth; destruction was before him. His teeth were swords, his ribs (were of bronze) . . . "

cu590_con | 1 | This page of a parchment codex is regularly cut at both sides and at the bottom; the top has broken away. Considerable damage and loss of parchment in the middle section. The flesh side is almost white, whereas the hair side is varying in color, from medium-brown to dark brown. (TC) Since thirty-one lines remain on both recto and verso, and probably three or four lines are lost at the top of the page, the columns originally contained thirty-four to thirty-five lines. The complete page with the intercolumnar space and the margins, which are not preserved, must have been approximately 32 x 10 cm. in size, which is a normal size for a ninth century manuscript.
