cu500_pal | 1 | Written in a style rich on ornamental lines which is characteristic for the first century B.C. To the right of the partially preserved column the papyrus contains two columns of scholia, which, unfortunately, are almost completely lost. These two columns of scholia start to the right of l. 1 (v. 835) and l. 6 (v. 840). They are written in a smaller hand, and the distance between the columns of scholia is smaller than the distance between the columns of the Euripides text. This explains why in both cases the second line of the scholia is located at the height of the interval between ll. 1-2 and 6-7 respectively. That suggests that the relevant scholia stretched over two lines.;The lyrical part is kolometrically written. Thus, the kola have been moved in according to their length.
