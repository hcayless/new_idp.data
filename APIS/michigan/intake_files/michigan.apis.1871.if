cu500_pal | 1 | Hand is not calligraphic but clear and similar to P. Mich. X 601. Despite the striking similarity of the two scripts, they were probably written by two different hands. Letters such as zeta and chi are formed in a slightly different manner. Also in P. Mich. inv. 3207, the scribe has consistently avoided iota adscripts, whereas that is not the case in P. Mich. X 601.

cu500_t | 1 | (Verso) "Agathokles to Demetrios greetings. You have not done well keeping the harvested grain until now unthreshed, because the water has made the grain damp, as the land is irrigated in that neighbourhood. Hence the rents are put at risk. Having learned that you were in Alexandria, I provided the logeutes with a legal instrument, so that it be threshed by me and I receive my share. Even now take care that not all . . . be inundated. Instruct me clearly what your plan is so that my mind is not in suspense. Otherwise, I will take advantage of the legal instrument.";(Recto): "To Demetrios".

cu590_con | 1 | Apart from a number of minor holes (ll. 2, 9, 12), the papyrus is preserved in very good condition. On the front the script runs against the fibers, whereas on the back, which contains a very faded adress, script and fibers run in the same direction.
