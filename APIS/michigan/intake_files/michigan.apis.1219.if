cu500_lin | 1 | 1-13
cu500_pal | 1 | The verso contains two separate texts in 2 separate columns. The first text (column 1), written   in a rather cursive hand, is a column of figures headed by the name Kaparis, followed by a paragraphus. The figures, with the exception of the first, are arranged in a descending series of the odd numbers from 1 to 19. There follow two signs which resemble somewhat ei() (dr.) but which are probably mere flourishes. The whole has the appearance of a writing exercise.;The second document (col. 2), written in a different hand, claims to be an account of wool, but it is probably also an exercise or memorandum. The scribe has marked the beginning of the account by starting the first line closer to the middle than the following lines.  In the last three lines the writer seems to be experimenting with the spelling of the first word. The sign for metretai in l. 1 clearly formede; it cannot be etous.; text 2 (column 2) appears to be written by a less practiced scribe with large, separate letters.
