cu590_con | 1 | This dark brown papyrus is regularly cut at the right side and it preserves the right margin. Broken off at the left, top and bottom sides. It is also damaged at the middle presumably because of a fold. There are some lacunae at several parts. The right side of the recto and the left of verso has a dark layer, probably oil. There are also two fragments do not belong to this papyrus are attached on verso need to be removed.
