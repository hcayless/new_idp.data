A few abbreviations: Coss, d(with a cross-bar) = d(ixit), up = v(ir) p(erfectissimus), praes. = praeses, Aeg. = Aegypti. It may be noted that the orders given by the prefect or the praeses have been written in a larger writing than the other sections of the text.

cu520 | 1 | The text on this papyrus is concerned with a verbal court process. The date, the commands from the prefect or from the preses and, probably, the announcements of the speeches given by the two parties or their advocates were in Latin, but the words of the parties or their advocates were in Greek, following standard practice. Unfortunately, the text is too fragmentary to establish the object of the process, and the Greek is so badly preserved that no more than a literal transcription of readable passages is possible.
