cu500_t | 1 | I, Orsenouphis (also called) Psosneus, son of Kalales, a weaver, acknowledge that I am under obligation to teach Helene, the slave of Herakleon, son of Eirenaios, the weaver&apos;s trade as I myself know it, for two years and six months dating from Pharmouthi of the present  forty-second year of Caesar, Helene being fed and clothed during the aforesaid time. I shall give to Helene a tunic worth eight silver drachmai. And if I shall not teach her, or she shall be considered not to know what she has been taught, you will perforce have her taught at my own expense. Herodes, son of Herodes, wrote for him at his request because he is illiterate.;(2nd hand) I, Herakleon, son of Eirenaios, have apprenticed the aforesaid slave girl as aforesaid.
