cu500_pal | 1 | The text is written in a commonplace cursive typical of the third century (though perhaps more typical late rather than early in the century), with no trace of chancery influence. At first sight the closing greeting (l. 16) appears to be in a different hand, suggesting that our text is an original to which the prefect added a greeting in his own hand. However, while undoubtedly written more hastily and cursively than the rest of the document, l. 16 need not have been written by a second hand. In fact the other side shows that the text on the verso is a locally produced copy, written on the back of an already used roll."

cu520 | 1 | The papyrus contains a letter to the strategoi and royal scribes of the Eptanomoi and the Arsinoite, giving instructions concerning preparations for a visit of Severus Alexander and his mother, Iulia Mamaea. It apparently reinforces a previous communication from the epistrategos, refers to a schedule of requisitions previously sent to the same officials and which they are now instructed to post up in public places, and insists that all requisitions are to be made within the proper limits only, severe penalties being threatened if the officials are caught overstepping the mark.

cu590_con | 1 | The papyrus is complete at the top and bottom and, for the most part, at the right, but a great deal is lost at the left, probably about two-thirds of the original document. Probably at least two-thirds of the papyrus has been lost in the best preserved lines, which indicates an original width of more than 40 cm.
