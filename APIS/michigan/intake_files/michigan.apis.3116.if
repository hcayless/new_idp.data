cu500_t | 1 | We, [Mieus and] Herakles, both [sons of Harmiysis, our mother being] Taarpaesis, and the [wife of Mieus], Tapnebtynis, daughter of Psonsneus, her mother being Taarmiysis, acknowledge that we, [Mieus and] Herakles, have sold, [in accordance with the Egyptian contracts], to Psonsneus, son of Orseus, [his mother being] Tapesouris, the share that belongs to us by inheritance from our father, of the vacant lot, that is partly [walled] in, and [all] the appurtenances [common and] undivided, in Tebtynis in the division [of Polemon]. The measurements of the whole vacant lot are from south to north eight ells, [from west to] east five ells, up to [as many as there may be]. The neighbors are on the south the open space of the temple of the god Herakles Kallinikos, on the north the house of [Mieus], son of Kouthis, on the west the house of the [purchaser] Psonsneus, on the east the house [of Panther] and in part the common entrance and exit. And we have received from the [purchaser], at once, from hand to hand, out of [the house, the entire] price agreed upon, [in full], and we guarantee with every guarantee forever. I, Tapnebtynis, [the aforesaid wife] of Mieus, [consent to the] sale and agree [not to proceed against it] and that no one else shall in my behalf forever, and that I shall not bring any claim. And we shall do [the other things] and agree to them [as aforesaid. Marepsemis, son of Marepsemis], wrote for them because they are illiterate.
