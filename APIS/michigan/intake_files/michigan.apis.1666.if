cu500_t | 1 | To Quintus Aemilius [Saturninus, prefect of Egypt], from Gemellus also called [Horion, son of Gaius Apolinarius], Antinoite, and however he is styled, [landholder at Karanis in the division of Herakleides] of the Arsinoite nome. [Some time ago], my lord, our father [died, leaving me and] my sister as heirs, [and we took over his] possessions, without [opposition] from anyone. [Likewise it came to pass] that my uncle also, [Gaius Iulius Longinus, died] eight years ago, and [I entered into ownership of his property] and collected [the income, without] hindrance [from anyone]. But now Iulius [and Sotas], both [sons of Eudas], wrongfully, with violence [and arrogance], entered my fields after I had [sown them and] hindered me therein through the power which [they exercise in the] locality, contemptuous [of me] on account of [my] weak [vision]. Wherefore [I have fled to you, the savior], asking you, if it seem good to your [Fortune, to hear my complaint against them], so that I may be able to recover [my property and receive this] benefaction from your hands [my lord.  Farewell. - - -]
