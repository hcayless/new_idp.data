cu500 | 1 | This fragment of a wooden tablet was prepared for use as a wax tablet, but later the wax was very thorouhly scraped off except for slight remnants in the corners. The surface of the wood suffered somewhat under the scraping. The tablet was then used for this document, written with ink on the wood. (...) The lines of writing run at right angles to the direction expected on the interior of a diptych but agree with a form of a triptych; signatures of witnesses would have been written on the back of the second of the three tablets.
