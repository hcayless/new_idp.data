cu520 | 1 | The text deals with medicine rather than magic; for the medicamenta, irrational as they appear to us, are the sole means of treatment. There are no prayers or spells. The line of demarcation between medicine and magic is, of course, not always easily drawn. Prayers, spells and substances are all applied in the same pragmatic way.;A certain arrangement is discernable. Page 167 deals with wounds, hemorrhages and swellings; page 168, with digestive disorders. The remedy for toothache is interpolated, because the roasted dove brings to mind the "dove-herb."
