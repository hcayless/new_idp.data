cu500_t | 1 | To my lord and brother Agenor, Neilos, greeting. You will do well, my lord, to lend your help to the man who delivers this letter to you, since the superintendent, Anubion, is holding him because he ran away in the time of Kastorion, whereas you have no worry on his account, for he said to me: ‚Ç£If he wants anything, I give it to him.‚Ç¥ For this reason I wrote to you. For if you are willing, his affair is concluded.;I pray for your continued good health.
