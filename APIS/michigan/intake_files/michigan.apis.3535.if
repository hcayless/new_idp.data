cu500 | 2 | Location: Ann Arbor
cu500 | 4 | Pub. status: Verso; Recto contains a circular letter (SB,15766)
cu500_lin | 1 | 1-14
cu500_pal | 1 | The text on this side contains 14 narrow lines written across the fibers in a small cursive style. There are two vertical folds which produce three segments, the left one being 3.8 cm., the middle one 5.1 cm., and the right one 7.8 cm. wide. The text is placed exactly in the middle segment leaving margins of 0.8 cm. to the left fold and of about 1 cm. to the right fold; the top margin is 2.5 cm., the text breaks off 11.5 cm. from the bottom of the papyrus. This placing indicates that the text was written after the papyrus was folded.

cu518 | 1 | Arsinoite nome, Ptolemaic Egypt
cu520 | 1 | This side of the papyrus appears to contain an incomplete memorandum or order to write another circular letter or a series of letters to Dexilaos, the strategos of the neighboring Memphite nome, and to financial and police officials subordinate to him. All but one are addressed by their name. The letter appears to be concerned with one Isidoros and his business partner, tax farmers of the apomoira tax. The details are uncertain, but it seems that this firm of tax farmers had reported (?) the anakechorekotes who owed them (altogether ?) 550 (silver ?) drachmas (?) for this tax.

cu590_con | 1 | Vertical fibers are ripped off close to the left margin. At the top and in the upper part of the papyrus this area is 2 cm. wide; in the lower part it is smaller (about 1 cm.), and it ends 2 sm. from the bottom, where the fibers are intact. Other vertical fibers are missing on the right side. Close to the bottom, there are slightly ascending lines across the entire papyrus. They start with a single stroke which unfolds into partially two, partially three strokes, and continue on the left and right side, where the vertical fibers have been ripped off. They must have been made after the fibers had been ripped off and when the entire surface of the back was open, presumably before it was folded.
