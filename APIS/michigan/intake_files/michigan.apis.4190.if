cu520 | 1 | In this letter N»Ìjid b. Muslim informs √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad that he sent him a symmachos (Ar. samm»Ìk) by the name of Peter to collect what the people of his district owe in oil-taxes. N»Ìjid further instructs √¨Abd All»Ìh to send some of his own symmachoi and his k»Ìtib to help Peter with the collection and transportation of the oil. If, however, √¨Abd All»Ìh encounters delay, N»Ìjid has instructed Peter to come to him to be assigned some more scribes and symmachoi from √¨Abd All»ÌhÇ«÷s colleagues.  N»Ìjid orders √¨Abd All»Ìh to hurry the completion of his commands and not to obstruct any of them, but to be trustworthy in completing this task, using an unusual expression for part of these otherwise very familiar orders. N»Ìjid closes with a warning not to let Peter cheat √¨Abd All»Ìh in any of the taxes presented to him.;The following documents are addressed to the same receipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).
