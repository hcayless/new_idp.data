cu520 | 1 | Recto, col. I, and Verso, col. I-XII, present accounts of expenditures made by Kronion and his colleague Eutychas, the officials of the record-office (grapheion) of Tebtynis, during the 6th year and the beginning of the 7th year of the Emperor Claudius. In view of their distribution on the papyrus and of their incompleteness, they were probably not compiled for inspection. - Verso, col. IV, which was cancelled with cross strokes, is a memorandum of loans received on May 22-23, 46 A.D., and does not really form part of the record of expenditures itself
