cu500_pal | 1 | The front side preserves one complete column and remains of a second column, written by a single hand (hd. 1). The back has a single column, the first tvelwe lines of which were written by the same scribe (hd. 1); the last tvelwe lines were written by another scribe (hd. 3). The principal scribe (hd. 1) wrote with heavy black ink. The scribe who completed the accounts on the on the back (hd. 3) used a narrow-nubbed pen and his letters are more finely formed, although his ink was also dark.The rubrics on the verso are often more fully expressed and these, in turn, can be used to clarify the entire document, in which at least seven different individuals figure. The accounts were verified and oblique lines drawn in the left margins of all the columns after outlays of cash by someone using a lighter and thinner ink (hd. 2). This person also wrote a note at the base of the first column on the front (l. 27).

cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains the account of a business establishment of diversified interests. In addition to amounts paid out for wages and foodstuffs, there are frequent references to the production of cloth and clothings. Hence it is likely that these accounts belong to one of the small textile establishments in Oxyrhynchos frequently referred to in the papyri of the Roman and Byzantine periods.
