cu500_pal | 1 | For a general description of the palaeography, see electronic version of 21 a-m. Contains writing in both hands, cf. electronic version of 21 a-m. Two double-curved lines are clearly written in the first hand to separate recipes. The second hand begins after the second double-curved line. One diaeresis in l. 7 and a paragraphos  after l. 6. Lot of margin in the left had side, in ll. 1-4 approximately 3 cm. and in ll. 5-8 approximately 2cm.; unfortunately too little text remains for a meaningful translation.

cu520 | 1 | Ll. 1-4 originally contained a complete recipe, as shown by the double-curved lines in the first hand, that of the scribe, cf. electronic version of 21 a-m. They were the last lines of a page of a codex. The content and the use of the recipe remains unclear due to the small amount of text still extant.
