cu500_pal | 1 | Written in a clear and somewhat formal semicursive. Second hand is much quicker and less careful. As the lines progress they have a tendency to move upwards. Free margins on all sides show that the text is complete; only line 16 extends to the right edge of the papyrus. The main section of the text (lines 1-15) is divided from the second section (the date) by a blank space of approximately 2.5 cm. (TC)

cu500_t | 1 | "Diogenes to Dorion his brother, greetings. I considered it necessary before all else to greet you in writing. Ypu wrote to me concerning the price of olive oil. It is still at a high price where you are and I do not think that one should buy at a high price. And previously I wrote to you about the pieces of wood, so that you should send them to me. Accordingly, if they be received by me, I shall pay the freight charges for them. But you will send me a metretes of olive oil at the current price, only of good quality. Good health. Greet Polydas my friend and all of your household. (2nd hd.) 8th year of Emperor Caesar Domitian Augustus Germanicus. Choiak 6.";Verso:"From Diogenes to Dorion my brother."
