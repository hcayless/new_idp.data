cu520 | 1 | Pen drawing of Sobk, Souchos, the crocodile god of the Arsinoite nome, in the shape of his sacred animal, lying on a litter, which is placed on top of a large stone platform or altar. In front of the god (to the right of the drawing) a small altar with votive offerings. Souchos is reposing in his shrine, or under some sort of canopy, resting on four columns, with festoons and bunches of flowers(?) hanging from one to another. The roof is adorned by a profile cornice. To the left on the ostracon there is a large blot of ink with a dozen vertical lines mounting from it (lake with reeds?)
