cu500_t | 1 | [Claudius] Terentianus to Claudius Tiberianus, his father, very many greetings. [Before] all else I pray for your health; I myself am in good health. I make obeisance for you daily in the presence of the local gods. I want you to know, my lord father, that from the day you left until today I have kept close to Aemilius, demanding(?) an explanation concerning those matters, and [he protested] that that man&apos;s chirographs [are] different and cannot be registered without the consent of the archidikastes . . . . I therefore gave him . . . another thirty-two drachmai, .whereupon [he] said . . ., "If you blame me ‚Çô either you or your father ‚Çô take back from me . . . which you have given me." For I submitted . . . [another] petition to the archidikastes through the same channel that he had used  for submitting [his] petition. I hope therefore soon to receive them [from him] duly completed and to forward . . . .
