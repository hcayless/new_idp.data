cu500_pal | 1 | The hand is a typically rapid, somewhat angular cursive of the first century A.D. A marginal space of 1.5 cm. was left at the top of the sheet, although a summary notation was subsequently entered there. As usual, no margin was attempted on the right side of the sheet. The left margin has disappeared in a vertical break, which has also produced minor losses along the entire side. The lower portion of the text has been torn away after l. 13.
