cu500_pal | 1 | The handwriting of this papyri is in two columns and is extremely rude and uneven, as though produced by some nearly illiterate person who seldom had occasion to write. The pen which he used was stiff and inelastic, and fed the ink badly, as though not properly split. The ink was too thick. The writer blotted letters or words, either by accident or because they did not suit him; and in the latter case he often repeated words standing before the blot. The whole performance suggests a negligent paralytic or a very young child. The letters are drawn, not written with the swing of an ordinary writer. For similar hands, cf. P. Mich. inv. 3565, British Museum MS No. 1224 (Catalogue of the Coptic Manuscripts in the British Museum (1905), Plate XII); a third is published by Crum(Receuil d&apos; 入tudes d权di权es a la m权moire de Jean Fran群ois Champollion (1922), Plate VII). As might be expected in a text of this nature there is a number of sketches at the bottom
