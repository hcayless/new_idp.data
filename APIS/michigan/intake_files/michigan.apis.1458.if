Take two of the seventeen bushels of wheat and apoute which are located at Phoibammon&apos;s place; and furthermore, two bushels of wheat that are in the monastery, and finally twelve bushels of barley; sell them when the price moves, and give nothing to Kolthe the carpenter, except for the price of the threshed grain, since I have received nothing from him. And do not let it shrink, give nothing to the household. And if an offence is commited against you at some occasion, which might happen in the monastery . . . and joy, oh my sister. And when my brother comes south, send him the entire load. Greetings through the Lord! (Christian sign)"
