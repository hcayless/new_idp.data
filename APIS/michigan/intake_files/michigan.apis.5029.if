cu500_pal | 1 | The text is written Transversa Charta along the fibers in two hands. Both are small sized cursive letters. The first is slow and used a thick pen; the second is faster and used a thin pen. Some words have been inserted between the first and second lines, and between the two last lines in the second hand. There is a blank space allows to write two lines between the two hands. It is obvious that the scribe abraded a word in line 5 and rewrote the word epakolouthesai instead.

cu590_con | 1 | Well preserved papyrus with a smooth surface; consists of two pieces as a result of a horizontal fold at the middle; both of them has the same pattern of holes, cut at the left side at the top in the first and at the bottom at the second piece. It seems that only the left part at this fold has been sliced rather than broken off. Although it is broken off at all sides, the right margin seems to be preserved. The lower side almost regularly cut mostly as a result of a fold.
