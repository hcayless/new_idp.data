cu500_pal | 1 | Written along the fibers in very large cursive letters with a tendency to uncial. The hand is slightly careless that there is some letters have been corrected, and the scribe dipped his pen into the inkwell to be sure getting the right form of those letters. The interlinear spaces are almost even of ca. 0.5 cm. The scribe wrote the opening of his letter by writing the letters in larger scale than the body of the text; alpha with two loops the lower one invade the interlinear space; V-shaped upsilon; iota shaped in a vertical stroke with a hook at the top; rounded big omicron. No abbreviations or other diacritical marks are attested.
