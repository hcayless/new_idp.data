cu300 | 1 | 1 papyrus ; 9 x 14 cm

cu500_pal | 1 | The left margin (or intercolumnar space) is 2.8 to 3 cm (and may have been wider, since there is no trace of the preceding column to fix the distance. The column of writing was originally about 9.5 cm in width. The lower margin is very deep, 6.5 cm. The ink is black. The writing is good book-hand. The archaic form of zeta is used, the horizontal of eta is usually set a little above the middle, and the upright of tau often touches the cross-stroke at the right of its center. Many of the upright strokes are turned slightly to the right at the bottom, and in several instances iota is delicate reversed curve, the top turning to left, the bottom to right. Iota adscript is written in the few places where it is in order. The acute accent is used nine times, and twice it is accompanied by a rough breathing in the form of an acute angle. The circumflex occurs four times, placed between the vowels "eu" and over etas preceding iota adscript. Elision is indicated with an apostrophe in l. 61 (line 6 of the preserved portion), but in two cases, where elision also accurs, there is no certain trace of this sign (ll. 68 and 69). Crasis is not indicated in l. 70 and in l. 65 the corrector substituted the full writing (KAIE) where the original scribe had written "KH". In l. 64 the corrector wrote "kallist[on" over "timi[on" without striking out the latter reading.
