cu500_t | 1 | "Sarapion to my brother Heraklianos, abundant greetings. I received the letter that you sent me on the 29th, but nevertheless when you get my letter, come up straight away, since they want to file the monthly report. For they are being harassed daily. Do you therefore put caution aside and come up. For thanks to . . . , from that day that . . . , I no longer had eyes for anything, for I lived daily in anxiety about the harbor from the day that you left home. Do you therefore not neglect to come up immediately . . . :;Verso: "Deliver to Heraklianos . . ."

cu590_con | 1 | When the text was completed, the sheet was folded five times vertically from right to left. It is probable that the lower half of the text was lost along a horizontal fold through the middle of the sheet, but perhaps more serious in its consequences for our comprehensions of the underlying situation is the abrasion of the ink at the end of lines 9-10 and the somewhat irregular tear which has removed the beginnings of lines 10-11.
