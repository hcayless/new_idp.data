cu500_t | 1 | To Titus Haterius Nepos, prefect of Egypt, from Sarapous, daughter of Petnes, son of Tithois, from the village of Karanis in the Arsinoite nome. My husband Peteeus from the same {same} village died leaving two orphan children, Theon and . . . nais, and property in grains and houses and furniture, all of which . eos, the brother of my aforesaid husband, lays claim to with violence. Moreover, . . . he entered the house by night and stole every thing that was in the house like a thief(?). Wherefore I brought in the archephodos of the village, who made a written deposition that it was the aforesaid brother who broke in. Therefore I have appealed(?) to you . . . asking . . . that you hear me against . . . that I may be the object of your benevolence.    Farewell.
