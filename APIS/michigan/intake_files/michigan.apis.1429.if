cu500_pal | 1 | The hand, while obviously awkward, maintains itself steadily through 30 lines. It remains throughout at an elementary level and has that look, in the shape and size of its letters, which has elsewhere been decribed as "retarded" (H.C. Youtie, Scriptiunculae II 646, n. 78). This deficiency is matched by the writer&apos;s frequent blunders in spelling.

cu500_t | 1 | "Ptollas to Isas, abundant greetings and good health. Know that in the letter which I sent you, there was not included in what was written there the statement: "Give the interest to someone but not the principal." I wrote saying that it is two years since you borrowed the money, but you sent me no word. For if I had not known that you are trustworthy, I would not have lent it to you. Knowing your good faith, I gave the note to no one. If you find someone trustworthy . . . send the interest and the principal. Year 37 of Caesar, Thoth 5. Farewell."

cu520 | 1 | Ptollas reminds Isas that two years have passed since he borrowed an unspecified sum from Ptollas. The latter maintains from start to finish a smooth, courteous, friendly tone, but leaves no doubt that he expects repayment at the earliest opportunity.

cu590_con | 1 | This papyrus is a long narrow strip, to which the writer has accommodated his text so as to leave noticeable margin on all sides, and especially on the right, where the somewhat irregular margin varies generally from 1.5 to 3.5 cm. This is unexpected because writers of documents tend to bring their text as close to the right edge as is feasible. The papyrus is regularly cut on all sides and has sustained only little damage.
