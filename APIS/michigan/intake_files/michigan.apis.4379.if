cu500_pal | 1 | Written along the fibers in relatively large ligatured letters. The hand is undoubtedly skilled and clear. Alpha sometimes appears in one loop and sometimes in two loops; kappa is usually in Y-shaped with stroke descend from the right arm; upsilon is V-shaped; epsilon is formed by drawing a curved stroke over a semi-vertical short stroke; while iota is a simple vertical stroke. No diacritical marks are used. Few letters are written on verso.
