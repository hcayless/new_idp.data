cu500_pal | 1 | Written in a fairly quick semicursive hand. To the left of the text is a margin of ca. 1 cm., but no comparable margins are discernible either above or below the comumn of writing. Although no text is to be seen above line 1 or line 10, the genitive in the first line suggests that some portion of the column has been lost at the top, and the state of the bottom suggests that the text may have continued below. A check-mark stands in the margin opposite line 8.
