cu500_pal | 1 | Although damage to the surface of the papyrus impedes reading in the left-hand portion of the letter, it is ultimately the idiosyncracies of the hand, presumably that of Lykarion himself, that make the entire letter difficult to read. His cursive is rapid, but irregular; at times he gives full articulation to individual letters, at other times he rushes on with &apos;saw-tooth&apos; strokes, giving only a suggestion of the words he knows that Tryphon will be able to read because of his insider&apos;s knowledge of the affair.

cu500_t | 1 | "Lykarion to Tryphon, his excellent one, many greetings and good health. In your presence we urged in support of Erotas, our friend, so that in the first instance you (?) would in fact lead &apos;his&apos; (?) Isidoros to cultivation of revenues and estate (land), and now we all do urge you, best gymnasiarch, to lead (him to the cultivation) and to be zealous still also now to make the demand - for Isidoros is not an Arsinoite of the metropolitans. Good health and you take care of yourself. Year 35 of (Augustus) Caesar, Pharmouthi 8.;(Verso): To gymnasiarch Tryphon."

cu520 | 1 | This papyrus contains a letter from Lykarion to Tryphon, which appears to be that directive desired of the prefect by Isidoros in his petition (P. Mich. inv. 1440, 14-16 and Inv. 1436, 6-9).

cu590_con | 1 | All four margins are preserved intact. The letter was folded five times from right to left and then twice from left to right, with the first fold on each side narrower than the succeeding ones. There is a kollesis at a distance of 8.5 cm. from the left margin; there is an overlap of 1 cm. The address on the verso was written on the exposed panel along the fibers, for the address is placed at 90o from the writing on the recto. Although this medium-brown papyrus is generally well-preserved, a pattern of holes follows the along the folds. Surface damage on the recto and discoloration on both recto and verso at the point of the exposed panel render the first 13 to 18 letters at left difficult to read at most lines. The discoloration was perhaps caused by water, since ink seeped through to the verso, producing vague mirror images of the writing; these reverse images are partially legible for lines 2 and 3, in the right margin; these suggest the papyrus was folded in haste, before the ink was dry.
