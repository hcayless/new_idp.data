cu500_t | 1 | Claudius Tiberianus to Longinus Priscus, his lord and patron, very many greetings. You know very well in what way I left you . . . to come to you soon. When I brought(?) to Alexandria with me . . . I found that the boats had already departed and I did not sell it. Know, my lord, that I am now in Alexandria; if I find an opportunity, I hope to come to you soon. I beg you, my lord, deign to write me where you are stationed, so that I may be able to find you there quickly and bring the . . . by boat. As I was about to send to you the letter that Sempronius Clemens, the frumentarius, will deliver to you, I found at his place, by dint of thought and good luck, also the two letters that you want, and I sent them to you under seal. I beg you, my lord, . . . I prepared . . . wooden staves(?). Claudius, my son, sends many salutations to you. (2nd hand) I pray for your good health, my lord. (1st hand) Salute . . . et Aristus et . . . et all your comrades(?). Farewell.;;(Verso) To Longinus Priscus, from Claudius Tiberianus . . . .
