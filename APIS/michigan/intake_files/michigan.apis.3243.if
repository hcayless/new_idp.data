cu520 | 1 | This papyrus preserves the beginning of a petition to the strategos Agathos Daimon. In the text that survives the petitioner does not reach the substance of his complaint. After mentioning the dowry brought to him by his former wife, he begins a statement about the offspring of the marriage. Conceivably he then drew attention to some difficulty connected with the disposition of the dowry among the children, if indeed there were more than one.
