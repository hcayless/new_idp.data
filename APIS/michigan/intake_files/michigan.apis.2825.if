cu500_t | 1 | Year six<teenth ....>;;;(To be copied) from the roll.;;;I, Harpaesis, son of Panorses, a Persian of the epigone, agree without reservation to make a plantation in a thicket on the dyles around the 300 arourai, from the present month, Sebastos, of the seventeenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, because I have written on these conditions and I have taken for myself at once and have received from the payment which was fixed to be given, from the 144 drachmai of silver, 60 silver drachmai on account, at once, from hand to hand, from Phileros, the slave. And I shall receive the remaining 84 drachmai in monthly installments, beginning with the month Mecheir, and I shall provide up to 150 living mulberry trees on the aforesaid enbankments, and I shall water them five times a month. If I do not provide them as aforesaid, <I shall be obliged to forfeit> the 144 drachmai of silver and the interest as aforesaid. Marepsemis, son of Marepsemis the lesones, wrote for him because he is illiterate.
