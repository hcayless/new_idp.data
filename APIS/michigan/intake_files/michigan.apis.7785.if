cu590_con | 1 | Big sheet of roll of mediocre quality; although the papyrus is badly damaged at the left and broken off at the right; the preserved part is in a very good condition; the text is well preserved and legible; it has the top and bottom margins; the papyrus was evenly folded at least 12 vertical times of 3.5 cm; it has numerous wormholes in three different patterns and positions: at the top, bottom and on the lower edge. The upper side has small wormholes; the lower side has bigger ones. There are two kolleses: one at the left side with overlap of 2.5 cm from the left edge; the second is ca. 14 cm from the right edge.
