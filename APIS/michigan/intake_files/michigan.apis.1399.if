cu300 | 1 | 1 papyrus ; 16.5 x 12 cm.
cu500 | 2 | Location: Ann Arbor

cu500_lin | 1 | 1-34
cu500_pal | 1 | This account is written in a cursive hand with a rightward slant. Remnants of a preceding column are visible at the left edge of the recto: short obliques and large black dots, which indicate a double check, perhaps by two different individuals. These marks are repeated after each entry in the first column. The broken right edge of the papyrus has carried away all of the payments of the second column as well as the check-marks which followed them. Another feature of this text are the kollema numbers placed before each entry, with diagonal strokes beneath each one.

cu590_con | 1 | This text is broken at the top and bottom, but very little can be lost from the top of the first column, since the verso was subsequently used for two adjoining private letters, written upside down with reference to the register, and the first letter, that on the left, bears the formula usually occuring at the end of a letter: "I pray for your good health." Three vertical folds visible, and a kollesis is placed 5.8 cm. from the left edge.
