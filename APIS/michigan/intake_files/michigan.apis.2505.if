cu520 | 1 | The text is too defective to permit a detailed analysis of the terms of the agreement. The settlement of property is almost completely lost, but it includes land, a house and court, and personal property which is described in more detail than usual. There is provision for the payment of debts that may still be due on the death of the donor. The text also provides for the care of the son till he becomes of age and apparently stipulate that the mother may reside on the property with her son as long as she lives. No guardian is provided. Peteeus reserves control of the property during his lifetime.

cu590_con | 1 | This mutilated and defaced fragment came with the two fragments described in P. Mich. inv. 5580a, but although it is also from a donatio mortis causa, it is not from the same document.
