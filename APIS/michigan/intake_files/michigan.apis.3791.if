cu500_pal | 1 | Besides the accounts on the wax faces, the diptych has some writing on the wood of this leaf. These letters were scratched in a vertical line across the top of the inner side, with the leaf held on its side. However, only two of these letters are legible. Then, across the outer side of the same leaf run two lines of incised letters from 1 to 1.5 cm. high.

cu520 | 1 | A series of letters with numerical significance. Taken numerically, the first line, without the final epsilon, might be either 50,555 1/6 or 15,555 1/6, and the second, without its final number, would be 11,111. But the numbers are probably to be read separately and most likely this is an exercise in coinage.
