cu520 | 1 | This letter is concerned with farm matters. Julianus writes to Kopres and asks that the latter send up Bathlas along with some animals which belong to Koryphos. These animals include some donkeys and one ass. The purpose for sending these animals was to enable Koryphos to come after some ropes for the vineyards. The animals, of course, would be used to transport the ropes.
