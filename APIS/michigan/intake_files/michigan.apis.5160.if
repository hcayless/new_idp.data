cu520 | 1 | N»Ìjid b. Muslim writes √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad that he has heard that some inhabitants of the villages under the latterÇ«÷s responsibility have caused him harm in some way and that he will send √¨Abd All»Ìh some official presumably to help him deal with the villagers. N»Ìjid further instructs √¨Abd All»Ìh to send Yaz_d to allocate tax-quotas on the inhabitants of one village, but not to credit him with these. N»Ìjid ends his letter with the request that √¨Abd All»Ìh write him concerning the men of the village. The end of the letter is missing and the address is written on the verso.  ;The following documents are addresed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).

cu590_con | 1 | Light brown papyrus. The original cutting lines are preserved on the top and left sides. Written with a thin pen in black ink which is effaced in some places, perpendicular to the fibers on Recto, parallel to the fibers on Verso. The papyrus fibers are frayed on the right side which has resulted in a loss of seven to ten letters at the beginning of lines 1-6. One large hole and a smaller one have resulted in a loss of text in the middle part of the last four lines. The bottom half is broken off.
