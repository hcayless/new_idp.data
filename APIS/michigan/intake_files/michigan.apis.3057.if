cu500_t | 1 | "A copy of a petition to the King. To Ptolemy the King, greetings from Ptolemaios, son of Asklepiades, a Persian, of the assistants, the concessionaire with Imouthes of the apomoira on the produce for wine and fruit for Arsinoe Philadelphus and the gods Philopatores for the 14th year for Kerkeosiris and other places . . . of the Arsinoite nome. I am wronged by Nikomachos, son of Heron, a resident of Alexandrou Nesos. For though he is possessed of an orchard in the vicinity of the aforementioned Kerkeosiris from which by law he must pay the one-sixth tax to Arsinoe Philadephus, having first registered with us and made a valuation . . . Nikomachus, whom I accuse, having first harvested the fruits of this orchard, transported them without having registered them or made a valuation. Since, therefore, because state revenue is involved, my case is in need of a judgment from the chrematistai, once they have reached a decision, . . . to NN the attendant . . . If what I write be true . . . . If this is done . . . saviour, I will receive justice."

cu590_con | 1 | This light-brown papyrus of a somewhat moderate quality has been torn on all sides, which has resulted in the loss of a considerable amount of text. Worst damage has been inflicted on the lower half of the document, where most of the papyrus has been lost. Consequently, only a small strip of papyrus containing the middle section of the text has survived. The papyrus has sustained further damage in the top right corner, although the damage is not quite as serious as further below. Extensive miscoloring of the papyrus due to large flakes of salt. Two smaller fragments not connected to the larger fragment.
