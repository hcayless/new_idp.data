cu520 | 1 | This letter is divided into two parts, not only topic wise, but also by the lay-out of the letter. N»Ìjid b. Muslim starts his letter to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad announcing that some guards (hurr»Ìs) came to him. The relationship between the guards and the s»Ìhib mentioned on the next line is not certain, but they probably all belonged to the same community or town whose name is lost in the lacunae at the end of line 5. N»Ìjid then mentions someoneÇ«÷s runaway or stolen mules perhaps belonging to a certain Kh»Ìlid asking that those be returned to him. In the second half of the letter N»Ìjid writes that a certain Marcus who had been holding a safe-conduct (am»Ìn) had absconded. N»Ìjid asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to return Marcus to him, ending the letter with the recommendation that √¨Abd All»Ìh is to complete these tasks without delay or obstruction. The letter is written by √¨Abd al-Ra»˘m»Ìn, a scribe in N»ÌjidÇ«÷s chancellery, who also wrote 4. The other persons named in this letter: Anio, Kh»Ìlid and Marcus do not appear in any other letter of the corpus.
