cu500_t | 1 | Valerianus to Sokrates, greeting. You must come down here quickly, since a friend of mine, Auliatus, promised me to settle the affair for you at once, if you come down to beg off from it. See to it, therefore, that you do not delay, lest Iulius sail off suddenly. You will please him also, for he is a stranger. Your daughter salutes you. (2nd hand) Farewell.;;(Verso) To Sokrates.
