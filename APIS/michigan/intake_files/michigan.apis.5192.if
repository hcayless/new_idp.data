cu500_pal | 1 | Both recto and verso are written along the fibers in different hands. At least three lines have been written in the left margin across the fibers on recto. The hand on recto is fast, practiced, large cursive with a tendency to ligatures. The interlinear space is narrow (of 0.2 to 0.4 cm). The hand has the characteristics of 4th Century. No diacritical marks are attested on recto. The hand on verso is very slow and careful; wrote in almost detached letters. Most of the text is washed out, only few lines are readable. The text occupies les than half of the papyrus then a large blank area with one line written vertically against fibers then two lines along fibers. From the characteristics of texts on both sides it seems that they are simultaneous, or a period of short time between them. No diacritical marks on verso.

cu590_con | 1 | Darkened brown papyrus; almost coved by a layer of dirt on recto and verso, which makes the texts on both are very hard to read in some parts. Broken off at the all sides; badly damaged at the bottom to the right side. The papyrus is broken off at the middle as a result of, at least, a fold at the middle, in addition to some other folds in several places.
