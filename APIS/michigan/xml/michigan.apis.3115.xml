                  <summary>Contract of loan of 200 drachmai by Thermouthion to her husband Dioskous, more or less replacing the dowry in a marriage without written contract; the text further precises that the money came from part of a house which she had inherited from her father and had sold recently (if not the same day), and that Thermouthion had given another 140 drachmai, also coming from the sale of part of a house, to her mother, as repayment to a (similar) loan from her mother to her father. This copy of the contract of loan was cancelled when the loan was repaid one year later, after the divorce of Thermouthion and Dioskous. (See also P.Mich. III, 194)</summary>
