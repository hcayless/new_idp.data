                  <summary>Notarial deed by which a dispute is settled between Aurelius Nikantinoos on the one hand and Aurelius Phoibammon and his wife Aurelia Anastasia alias Tekrompia, represented by Anastasia's uncle, Apollos son of Dioskoros, on the other hand, concerning a piece of land. This was originally owned by Nikantinoos's parents, who used it to secure a loan from Iosephios and his parents; this liability went to their heirs, including Nikantinoos, while the property itself was inherited by Nikantinoos's nephew and nieces, and then sold by them to Phoibammon and Anastasia. The settlement, made with the advice of mediators, is that Phoibammon and Anastasia pay an indemnity in cash and in kind to Nikantinoos for paying the mortgage on this piece of land and ratifying the sale</summary>

as the representative of the two of you, the aforementioned.;Because these things, then, have taken place in this way and we are content and pleased with them, both I, Nikantinoos, and Apollos, village chief, because of this and in accordance with the judgment of the mediating friends, I have proceeded to this written agreement of settlement through which I, the aforementioned Nikantinoos, acknowledge of my own free will and by my own irrevocable choice and with honest intent, of sound mind, without any fraud and without fear and force and deceit and compulsion,;on the one hand that I have received and have been paid in full by you, the aforementioned Phoibammon and Anastasia, represented by you, the aforesaid Apollos, village chief, that what has been agreed upon to be given to me in accordance with the fair judgment of the mediating friends, i.e., seven solidi minus fourteen carats and twenty artabai of wheat according to the five-measures standard, in order that from this very moment I hand over to you the said deed of security for cancellation,;and on the other hand that I have or will have no claim against you and your heirs and successors and their substitutes by default, nor against the said Apollos and his heirs, - neither I nor my heirs or successors nor their substitutes by default, - neither with regard to the said debt, which has now been paid by me to Iosephios for the redemption of the said estate, nor with regard to the said deed of security, nor with regard to the possession or ownership of the aforementioned estate located in the plain of the said village of Aphrodite in the lot called Mounlakon south of the road that leads to the village of Tmonechthe, nor regarding its proceeds, nor regarding anything whatsoever that belongs to the said estate by legal right or does not belong to it, small or large, written or unwritten, adjudicated altogether or not.;but (I acknowledge) that you have by legal right of ownership for ever the possession and the ownership of the aforesaid estate with every legal right that belongs to it, because I have received in full what has been agreed upon to be given to me by you represented by you, the aforesaid Apollos, i.e. seven solidi minus fourteen carats according to the goldsmiths��� standard of the said village and twenty artabai of wheat according to the five-measures standard,;and (I acknowledge) that I have been released and am settled with you on all points and that from now on no legal action whatsoever is left for me against you, either personally or with regard to your property, whether the action is fitting or can be made to fit, from all preceding time until the present and abovementioned day and for all subsequent and everlasting time;
