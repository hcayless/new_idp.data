For I did not receive the afore-mentioned gold but the assistant did and he gave it to his headman and also to Victor, the toporetes being together one and a half pounds of gold. I do not know what else his headman received. The same most illustrious Sarapammon received the gold from his headman".;The illustrious comes militum said: "What has the most magnificent Sarapammon to say regarding this after he has heard the voice of Menas saying all that has been saidot he persons before the court that gold has been asked by Zacharias and has been paid to him?";The illustrious afore-mentioned Flavius Sarapammon said: "I did discover that some persons from the village of Aphrodite made a conspiracy and wanted to divide the village in two parties(?) so that they again could attend minutely to murders and for that reason the conspirators have been asked for one pound of gold for the praesidial treasury.";The illustrious comes militum said: "The administration will bring pressure to bear upon the most magnificent Sarapammon for the production of Zacharias  in court. What has Menas to say about the accusations ?";The soldier Flavius Menas said: "I did not murder anyone and I also prove it. What if Menas proves(?) it? The same presbyter feeling nauseous stayed in the church and I in Antaiou (polis) and an abscess came out of the throat of the presbyter and he died thereof. About Herakleios I was not there and I do not know (about him).";The illustrious comes militum said: "If the prosecuting party wants to attack with their accusations they must - - - the law for prosecution".;Flavius &lt;- - -&gt; defending Theodoros said: "In the last days of the passed month Mesore of the past seventh indiction the devoted Menas forced my brother Victor who also is a presbyter outside and murdered him having thrown a piece of wood of a machiehis left arm and having (placed) many blows on his stomach from the fifth hour till the evening of the same day and I reserve against him the law me suiting against murderers. And if I shall not prove that he murdered my brother I shall die instead of him. And he did not ask for the blows he received or it must be by the fact that he was ten or eleven days alone".;The afore-mentioned Maria defending Theodoros said: "The chiefs (of the police) of my village Aphrodite together with others who are in its service after having arrested my husband Herakleios put him in the watch-house of my village Aphrodite and after having taken wine to the same watch-house they drunk with him and when the evening had come they beat my same husband Herakleios and killed him with their swords and thereafter they gave his remains to the fire and they did this to him on the eighth of the month Phaophi of the passed sixth indiction at the setting of the sun. Being asked why they murdered my husband they said: 'The most illustrious Sarapammon and Menas wrote us to kill him', and I reserve against them the law me suiting regarding the death of my wretched husband. When Herakleios, my wretched husband, had been killed and his remains had been given to the fire so that they may be burned they poured again water on the same remains and they threw his bones in a basket and burried them I do not know where. I ask, therefore, that they are given to me so that I can burry them.
