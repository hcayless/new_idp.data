                  <summary>Salt b. al-Muh��jir starts his letter to ìAbd All��h b. Asìad with very extensive opening greetings and blessings. While the lines that follow are only partially legible, Salt seems to write that he was unable to answer ìAbd All��h���s letter asking him to buy him something due to the unavailability of messengers. He then writes in response to another letter from ìAbd All��h that he bought him two din��rs worth of chick peas as requested. ìAbd All��h had also asked Salt to pay back a debt of ten din��rs sending his servant Zayd to collect the money. Salt writes that he is only able to send five din��rs with Zayd, the two din��rs worth of chickpeas and three more din��rs in cash. Salt promises to pay back the remaining five din��rs after a trip to Lower Egypt.;All of the following documents are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5624; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).</summary>
