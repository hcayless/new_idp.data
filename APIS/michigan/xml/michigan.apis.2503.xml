                  <summary>The testator, whose name is lost, is a son of Didas and Dioskorous and grandson of Didymos. His two sons, Ammmonios and Herakleides, share equally in the estate, which consists of one aroura of vineyard, and the half share of a house and a courtyard held in joint ownership with the testator's brother, Moschion. The right to reside on the property and to have the services of the slaves bequeathed by her husband is secured to the wife, Kleopatra, for as long as she lives and remains unmarried. Provisions for the burial of the father are unusually detailed, but unfortunately they fall in the most mutilated portion of the papyrus. The amount of money to be spent, not less than two hundred drachmas, is designated, as well as the place where the body is presumably to be interred, near the Labyrinth.</summary>
