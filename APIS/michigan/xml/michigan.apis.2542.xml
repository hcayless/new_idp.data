The one who breaks the contract shall pay to the one who abides or will abide by it [the damages and expenses two-fold] and an additional fine of one-hundred drachmai of silver and [a like amount] into [the treasury]; and the aforesaid terms of the contract shall [none] the less remain [valid as aforesaid. The signatory] of Pnepheros is Heron, son of Satyros, about thirty-seven years old, with a scar in the middle of his forehead.;(2nd hand) [I, Pnepheros, son of Satabous], acknowledge that I have divided with my brother Psenobastis [from the present time] forever the cultivation of the [nine and one-half and one-eighth] and one-sixteenth and one-sixty-fourth [arourai of royal land] which we cultivate near Patsontis and of the [two and one-half arourai] of the Anthian estate, and that I [have received] as my allotted share [three and one-half] arourai of royal land and [two and one-half arourai of the Anthian estate], of which two arourai are in the Strategikon and at the entrance [the two and one-half arourai of the Anthian estate], one-half aroura is in Tatnouei bordering on the property of Kastor, [son of Phanomgeus], one-half and one-quarter [arourai are in the Geeina], and one-quarter aroura is in the Fifty [held in common and undivided with Apion], son of Phasis.
