                  <summary>A Fayyum estate-agent, AbȦ æl-����rith, received a letter from his estate-holder, then on business in Alexandria. The estate-holder, whose name is lost, recounts for AbȦ æl-����rith the course of a trip he is in the process of making from the Fayyum, the towns along the Nile at which has stopped and certain of his expenses en route. After announcing the successful conclusion of his business in Alexandria, he turns his attention to matters on the estate, for which AbȦ æl-����rith was evidently responsible.</summary>

            <ab>1. . . . . . . . . . . . . . On day X] we embarked from Daámët;2. and we arrived in] Sayl[a] on Thursday. We reached Fust��t on Saturday evening;3. and the full moon appeared to us on Saturday evening in Fust��t. Then we headed;4. for Rashëd in seven days. And my rental expenses from Rashëd to Alexandria amounted to;5. one dën��r minus half a qër��t. Having arrived in Alexandria, we stayed;6. there for a week. Then we displayed our goods (for sale) on Monday and Allah supported our 	display,;7. thanks be to Allah. Make sure, oh AbȦ æl-����rith, that for my sake Yuáannis;8. . [. . .] the old man (shaykh) with the wheat of the mill and sift [it] and take it. And when;9. each one is done, then send Zayd and let him measure each on. And order Sanb��;10. not to neglect improve the field. And if you are able to, obtain;11. for me the land of BilatȦs b. Bëhawëh���s which you mentioned, (then do so);12. if you think it a good idea. Or tell Yuáannis b. Sawërus (to give it to me), for he has 	already;13. promised me ten fadd��ns. And I have received what you sent;14. with AbȦ Jumìa. I ask Allah on our and your behalf for health in;15. this world and the next, and may He complete for us and for you his bounty and cause us;16. and you to enter into Paradise through his mercy. I wrote this letter of mine to you when 	three;17. and twenty (days) had passed of Jum��d�� I (and) twenty-six (days) of;18. BaæȦna. And I have already sent to you with R��shid my mule (birdhawn), it being in good 	health;19. and there not being a fault in his back. So, make sure, may Allah have mercy on you, to 	send it back to me;20. one month after the pressing. And R��shid has already promised me that he will bring it 	to me.;21. So when the month of pressing will arrive, let it be fed barely however much it eats.;22. Give many greetings to Sanb�� and admonish him to take care of Daf��ya? And give to 	AbnȦla,;23. your scribe, many greetings.;24. And peace be upon you and Allah���s blessings.</ab>
