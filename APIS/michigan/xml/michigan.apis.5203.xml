                           <ab type="conservation">Dark brown triangular fragment; broken off diagonally at left and right to form triangle with a vertex facing down and its base facing up. There are three minor wormholes; it has the upper margin. Some of the survived text is partly washed out and it���s clear and legible on verso; there is a diagonal dark line of mud at the left side on verso. Fragments A and B have almost a similar shape except for A has its vertex down and in B is up; probably the whole document was broken off when it was folded. There is a small piece of scotch tape at the top to the left.</ab>
