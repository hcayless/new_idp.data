cu520 | 1 | Theodoros had delivered 90 artabs of wheat to be transported to Alexandria and placed to his account.  Of these he had received, on Zenonss order and at various times, 55 artabs from Artemidoros the steward of the household, so that Zenon still owed him 5 artabs. He now demands the balance in order to repay Artemidoros the scribe, from whom he had borrowed corn. But the steward refused to deliver any more wheat, even if Zenon should order him. So he urges Zenon to see that the wheat is delivered, as otherwise he will hold him responsible for the price of it.
