cu520 | 1 | A letter from Philiskos the chief oikonomos of the Arsinoite province.  Before Zenon's letter reached him he had heard from the people in Tanis that there was some trouble about the water.  He has therefore sent work to Maimachos the nomarch to repair the mouth of the canal and he writes to Zenon to keep him informed.
