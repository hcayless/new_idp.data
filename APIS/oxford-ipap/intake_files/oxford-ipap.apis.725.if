cu520 | 1 | Horos was one of the farmers whom Zenon employed to look after the land which he exploited, particularly that which he leased from the cleruchs.  This Egyptian overseer, who writes or dictates a very halting Greek, informs Zenon that there be 120 arourai planted with poppy by the 12th of Choiak, a sight to please his eyes. On the back of the letter is a note in the same hand about a kläros which he apparently wished Zenon to lease: we have got a holding to the north; it gives us twenty arourai on which to plant kiki; let Zenon take two thirds and the owner keep one third.
