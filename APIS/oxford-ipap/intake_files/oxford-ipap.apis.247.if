cu520 | 1 | Receipt of a pawnbroker. A certain Callinikos has borrowed from [...] a sum of 33 golden coins, and has given in, as a pledge of payment, (capital and interest) some objects of precious metal. He died before the redemption date, which has subsequently arrived, and the lender claims from his son Constantine the restitution of the debt. Constantine, who performs the duties of singularis to the dux of Thebaid, having been unable to discharge the debt in money, renounces the pledges handed in by his father. As for the note signed by the aforementioned, as the lender has not been able to return it, they agree that it shall be cancelled by the present receipt. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
