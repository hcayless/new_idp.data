cu520 | 1 | Theon, who had been recommended to Zenon by the lately departed Epharmostos (?), acknowledges that he is being treated with generosity, but begs for some regular work in order that he may feel justified in accepting Zenon's bounty and that Zenon  may have the satisfaction of receiving something in return. He scorns the idea of wishing to be idle and asks Zenon to assign him a lodging and all things necessary, so that he may be free from anxiety in his old age.
