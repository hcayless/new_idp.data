cu520 | 1 | A contract stating that Zenon had lent six farmers 10 drachmae each and three others 8 drachmae each, to buy donkeys for the purpose of carrying in their crops.  The farmers were Egyptians who rented land on the estate of Apollonios at Philadelphia and the money was to be repaid before the end of Pachon along with the rent, or else a donkey, approved by Zenon, was to be handed over instead of it. In case of default Zenon could exact restitution from them and their guarantors. Each farmer is guaranteed by a friend, one of which is a Greek. Then follow the names of the six witnesses, four Greeks and two Egyptians, one of the latter being the town clerk of Philadelphia.
