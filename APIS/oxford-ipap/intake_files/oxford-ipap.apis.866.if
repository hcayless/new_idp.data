cu520 | 1 | Apollonios speaks, apparently in a tone of dissatisfaction, about the clearing of part of his estate for cultivation, saying that he has written to Zoilos to send surveyors to measure it up, and orders Panakestor to sow the land and see that none of it is left uncultivated. The gist of lines 1 - 11 seems to be that he is displeased to find that so much land needs once more to be cleared of brushwood inspite of the money already spent on it.
