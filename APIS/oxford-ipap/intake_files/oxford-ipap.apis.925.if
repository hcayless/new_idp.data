cu520 | 1 | The writers, probably merchants, ask Zenon if they will be able to obtain 500 metretai of must from the Philadelphian vineyards and what prices they will have to pay, and also if they will have to send him earnest money or a supply of wine-jars.  They also want to know how much corn they will be able to buy up and at what prices.
