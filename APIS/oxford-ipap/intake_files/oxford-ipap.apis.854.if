cu520 | 1 | Addaios, an agent of Apollonios at Memphis, writes to Zenon on various matters:  first he speaks about a fatted fowl which Zenon had asked for.  Next he complains that the tax-farmers or toll-collectors had confiscated some wine which he had been selling and that they refused to give it back in spite of the intercession of Apollonios, brother of Pythangelos; and he asks Zenon to intercede himself with the higher authorities. He then asks for an order to be sent, perhaps about the delivery of a certain article, and he begs Zenon not to forget to have purchases made for him of some other material of which he is running short.
