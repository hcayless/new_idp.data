cu520 | 1 | On the recto of this papyrus are the beginnings of the first seventeen lines of a letter from Epimachus to Panares written about A.D. 120-160. On the verso is a letter to the same Epimachus from a friend called Morus,  who together with Panares had been winnowing some barley under difficulties caused by the weather. The script is the rude uncial of an illiterate writer, who makes numerous mistakes of spelling in spite of several corrections.
