cu520 | 1 | Iason writes that he has gone to Moithymis to see Leon about the eparourion, of which five years' payment at the rate of three drachmae per aroura was being exacted for the vineyard and orchard.  He had asked Leon to wait and not sell the wine until Iason had written to Zenon. So Leon had given him three days in which to settle. Metrodoros also had written to Hermolaos to stop the sale until Zenon had been written to.
