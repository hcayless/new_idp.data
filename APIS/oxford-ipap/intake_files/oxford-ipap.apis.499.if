cu520 | 1 | Demetrios, a grammateus stationed in Cyprus, had gone over to Phoenicia on some business, and having expended his travelling allowance on purchases in Tyre he begs Zenon to send him 150 drachmae to Beirut.  Zenon himself at this time was probably leading a wandering life, as Demetrios asks him where he will have to send him the money.
