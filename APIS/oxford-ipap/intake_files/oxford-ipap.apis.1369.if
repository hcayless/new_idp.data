cu520 | 1 | This letter is almost identical to another written a few days earlier, both containing directions that a man should be sent to see an olive-yard belonging to a friend called Hermonax, which required thinning.  Probably Sabinus did not immediately comply, and Gemellus became impatient and wrote again. At the end of each letter is a request for fish for certain festal occasions.
