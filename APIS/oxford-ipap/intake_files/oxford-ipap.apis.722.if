cu520 | 1 | Kleanax writes to Zenon about certain mules which he had sent his slaves to buy and hand over to Zenon in order that they might be sent down along with those of Apollonios to the dürea of the latter in Memphis.  The object of this manoeuvre, as he frankly explains, was that they might pass as Apollonios' property and escape being taxed for export and transit. He wishes to know if they have come to hand and been dispatched and Zenon has settled the matter; and if they have not yet come to hand, he begs him to give orders to his people to do as he, Kleanax, has requested.
