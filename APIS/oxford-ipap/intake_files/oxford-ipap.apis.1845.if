cu520 | 1 | This fragment of a leaf of a vellum codex contains part of Thuc. Iii 7-9, with fairly numerous stops (in all three positions), paragraphi, accents, breathings, and diaereses. The only correction preserved, the insertion of a nu ephelkustikon in l. 45, is is due to the original scribe, who wrote a good-seized upright oval uncial hand of the fifth or sixth century. Iota adscript is omitted once and written once. Traces of ruling are discernible on the recto, which is the hair side. The text stands somewhat apart from mediaeval mss., agreeing once with CGM, probably twice with the B group and presenting several new readings. Found together with P.Oxy. XIII 1616.
