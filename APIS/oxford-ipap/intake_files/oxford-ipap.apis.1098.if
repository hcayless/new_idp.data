cu520 | 1 | Kallisthenes had been arrested for failing to pay the balance of a debt, the creditor probably being Zenon.  He had given some of his goods in pledge and he possessed some wine still unsold; all this was likely to be lost if he was kept in prison.  He therefore begs Zenon, after summoning him and hearing his case, to set him free so that he may be able to collect the remainder of the money and pay his debt.
