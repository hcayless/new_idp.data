cu520 | 1 | Paesis, a potter, writes to show how zealous he is for his employers' interests.  He calls attention to the likelihood that some of the potters who are coating the inside of the jars with pitch may be careless and give some of them a double coat, and to prevent any waste of pitch he proposes that he himself along with three others should be put in charge of the work. The potters, he says, bear him malice, saying that he is always writing against them to Zenon; but he pays no heed to them and is determined to report everything that Zenon ought to know. He has lately delivered to Anosis 2000 jar-lids, while the other potters have delivered nothing; wherefore they regard him with an evil eye.
