cu520 | 1 | A memorandum about a boat which apparently belonged to Zenon.  In lines 2 - 7 the writer states the present cost of upkeep.  In lines 8 - 14 he suggests an alternative way of paying the crew, by giving them monthly rations of wheat and deducting so much from their wages. In lines 15 - 19 he makes another proposal: he will pay Zenon a yearly rent of 500 drachmae; Zenon on the other hand will pay the Government tax, and if he requires the boat at any time, so much will be deducted from what the writer pays in rent and wages. Lines 20 - 28 propose still another arrangement: instead of paying rent the writer will be responsible for the Government tax as well as the sailors' wages, and the boat will be at Zenon's service when required, the only burden on Zenon being the provision of 72 artabs of wheat for the sailors and 18 for the writer. But naturally Zenon will bear the cost of the necessary repairs.
