cu518 | 1 | Antinoopolis (?)
cu520 | 1 | Twelve fragments, not  joining up, of a deed for the gift of land (the verb dürein is repeated twice), in favour of a monastery, as the term to psuchüpheles, which is found on one of the pieces, seems to indicate. According to the beginning of the document, the period seems to be the reign of Justin II; a later date is not very probable. The town of Antinoopolis is mentioned; perhaps this is where it was drawn up. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
