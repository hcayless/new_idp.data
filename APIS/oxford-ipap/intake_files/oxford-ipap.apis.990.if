cu520 | 1 | Theopompos had come on Zenon's behalf to settle the account, but Teos had been  busy at the time.  Now, however, Zenon may send anyone he likes to bring him a report.  The sum received from Zenon was 200 drachmae.  Against this he has delivered 150 choes of honey, of which 50 are given to Zenon for his private consumption, while the remaining 100 are valued at 160 drachmae; thus he still owes 40 drachmae. Teos is ready to pay this sum either in honey or in cash. If Zenon likes he may summon and question him about the account; he will find that Teos is treating him quite fairly.
