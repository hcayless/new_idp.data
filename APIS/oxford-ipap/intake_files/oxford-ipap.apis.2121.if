cu520 | 1 | Petosiris sends a petition to the officials of Oxyrhynchus to explain that his underage son who lives with him in his residence, should be registered instead in the quarter where Heracleides resides, since the boy is to learn the chalcotypike techne from Heracleides. The main part of the document is an antigraphon, and it is signed by Petosiris who states that he is in possession of the original.
