cu520 | 1 | The recto of this papyrus contains parts of sixteen lines of a late third-century account. On the verso, written in a clear semi-cursive hand probably of the first half of the fourth century, is part of an edict of Aurelius Herodes, praeses of the Thebaid, directed against the use of the whip in the punishment of free men. For slaves, he says, this is permitted, though to be deprecated; but for the free it is illegal. In their case the proper instrument, according to Roman law, was the fustis, and even this came to be regarded as out of place for persons of superior station.
