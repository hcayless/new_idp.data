cu520 | 1 | The upper part of a column containing (1) in ll. 1-9 a list of arrears of taxation, ranging from 4 to 32 drachmae, due from various persons whose trades were generally stated, possibly because the tax was the cheirünaxion; (2) in ll. 10-14, part of a similar list of arrears of rent for buildings owned by the State, the figures being ommitted. The title on the verso mentions the current 5th year of a joint reign, which was probably either that of the Philippi or Valerian and Gallienus.
