cu520 | 1 | An account of linen garments and napkins issued from the store over a period of fourteen months, and it was presumably preceded by a statement of the quantities which the writer had in his charge (PCZ.59088).  The articles were given out for the most part during the tour of Apollonios and Zenon, and not only are the entries dated, but the scribe usually mentions the place where they were staying at the time. As Zenon followed the same practice in docketing his correspondence during these months, we can make a fairly good itinerary of the first tour, which ended at Alexandria in Xandikos of year 29.
