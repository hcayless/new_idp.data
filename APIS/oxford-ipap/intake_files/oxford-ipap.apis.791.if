cu520 | 1 | A badly preserved letter from Artemidoros the physician, probably written in Alexandria.  He has heard that Petos the swineherd has run away and that a great many pigs are missing (the herd seems to have belonged to Artemidoros himself).  He therefore asks Zenon to have inquiries made as to where Petos has fled and to see that the securities are either jailed or bailed until satisfaction has been obtained. At the end he acknowledges receipt of a pig which Zenon has sent him.
