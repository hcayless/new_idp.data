cu520 | 1 | Lykourgos had already written to Zenon asking him to recover a sum of money from Agathokles after giving back to him some silver plate.  If Zenon has not carried out the former request, he is now to give the plate to Hermias, the bearer of the letter, who will himself recover the money. As Zenon notes in the docket that the plate is to be given to Hermias, we may infer that he had paid no attention to the former letter.
