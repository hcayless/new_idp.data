cu520 | 1 | A petition addressed to Aurelius Heron, strategos of the Arsinoite nome.  The petitioners are Ta‹sis and Kyrillous, daughters of Kopres, of the village of Karanis.  They charge that their paternal uncle Chaeremon had appropriated all movable goods left by their father at his death. They appealed to the local prostates, but his decision in their favour had no effect on Chaeremon. They now therefore put their claim before the strategos and append a list of the property in question.
