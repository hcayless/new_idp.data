cu520 | 1 | A list of cleruchs in various places, to whom the rest of the rent for year 36 is due to be paid.  The rent was paid partly in wheat and partly in barley, but sometimes the landlord preferred to have a portion of it commuted into money at the rate of seven artabs of wheat to the tetradrachm and about five artabs of barley to the drachma. The text shows what a large share Zenon took in the exploitation of the cleruchies.
