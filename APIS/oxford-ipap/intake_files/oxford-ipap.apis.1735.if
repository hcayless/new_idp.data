cu520 | 1 | Both sides of this remarkable papyrus are occupied with literary compositions of an unusual type.  On the recto are three columns of a low comedy or farce, the dramatis personae being carefully distinguished and stage directions added.  On the verso are, firstly, part of a mime, which is mainly a monologue, and secondly another column of dialogue in the style of the recto, involving the same characters, but written in a different hand.
