cu520 | 1 | Patymis had been brought before Zenon on an accusation of robbery, though everyone knew him to be innocent, and his accuser Patis had received from Zenon an order to take certain action.  But from that day till now Patis had been living with Sesongosis in Karanis. Zenon would therefore do well to summon Sesongosis and his confederates and learn the truth from them; for Patis is screening them because he is receiving a share of the plunder.
