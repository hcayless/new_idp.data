cu520 | 1 | A letter from a steward or agent enclosing some accounts and giving other information, and asking for various supplies. In the left-hand margin there are some indications of a previous column, which perhaps contained the accounts referred to; and the verso is also inscribed with 22 lines, incomplete on both sides, of an account, but it is in a ruder hand than that of the recto, though it corresponds well enough with the description in ll. 3-5. A curious reference to a hippopotamus occurs in ll. 20 sqq. of the letter.
