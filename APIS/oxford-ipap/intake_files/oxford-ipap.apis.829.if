cu520 | 1 | Kallikrates writes that he has received the letter from Zenon and also those addressed to Apatourios.  As the fact that Apatourios had been written to prevented him from settling the business himself, he had given the letters, sealed up as received, to Zenon's messenger and ordered him to take them to Apatourios.
