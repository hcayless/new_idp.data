cu520 | 1 | Herakleotes was a young musician who was being trained to take part in public competitions.  Demeas, the late head of the palaestra in Philadelphia, had left him in his will a musical instrument and had assigned him an allowance to enable him to complete his training. The present text is a request from Herakleotes for an advance of two months' salary and good allowance.
