cu520 | 1 | Two contracts for loans of money.  In one particular year, Ptolemaios, Persian of the epigone, was obliged to borrow ready money twice from the same wealthy man, viz. 600 drachmae on Pharmouthi 20th, and 1400 drachmae on Mesore, epagom. 3rd, in the thirteenth year of the reign of Antoninus Pius. The rate of interest payable was that customary at the time, 12%. The first sum mentioned was loaned against security of a female slave, the second sum secured against half of a house at Oxyrhynchus.
