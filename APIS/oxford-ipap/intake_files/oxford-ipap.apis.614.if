cu520 | 1 | Mys writes about a certain Symbotes, perhaps a cleruch, for whom a piece of land had been selected but not yet measured out.  Owing to this state of things, Mys could take no steps with regard to the crops, which ran the risk of being ruined.  Symbotes, however, paid no heed to his remonstrances but continued to wrangle with the royal scribe, insisting that the land should be measured by another standard, which would make a difference of ten percent in its area. Zenon is asked to give instructions about this matter as soon as possible.
