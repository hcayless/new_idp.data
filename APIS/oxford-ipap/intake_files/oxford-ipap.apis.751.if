cu520 | 1 | Herakleides had contracted to pay 375 drachmae for the right of exploiting a vineyard of 37 1/2 arourai for one year.  Moreover he had bought vegetables, fruit and roses on a large scale and had entered into various other transactions, so that the whole amount of what he owed came to 851 drachmae, 5 obols. From this had to be deducted his wages for work on the vineyard in the next year and various other sums due to him, reducing his debt to 305 drachmae, 3 obols.
