cu520 | 1 | Petesouchos informs Alexandros that he has dispatched a certain functionary to superintend the import of wine and exact the one per cent duty for the district of Philadelphia.  If Alexandros has seized any wine or other goods as security for unpaid duty, it is to be put in the charge of the newcomer until the money has been paid into the bank. Alexandros is also to give him the account for Payni, so that he can follow it up.
