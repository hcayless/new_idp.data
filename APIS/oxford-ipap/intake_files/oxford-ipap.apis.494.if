cu520 | 1 | Fragments of a series of letters, which may be copies or carefully prepared drafts.  Those on the recto refer to the Palestinian period of Zenon's career.  The second letter in column 1 speaks of Bethanath and Joppa, while the first in column 2 seems to be about a consignment of frankincense and myrrh. Those on the verso mention Philadelphia, and the second letter is perhaps concerned with the work of the quarrymen there.
