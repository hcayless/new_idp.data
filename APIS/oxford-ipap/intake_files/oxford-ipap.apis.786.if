cu520 | 1 | Paramonos says that he has already written about the thirty drachmae, asking Zenon either to send him a mattress or return the money, but now he would prefer to have the  mattress.  If it costs more than thirty drachmae, he will pay the difference to Ephermostos or any other person whom Zenon may name. He aks him also not to forget about the pig for the festival and to let him have one worthy of yourself and Epharmostos, Zenon and Epharmostos being pig-breeders.
