cu520 | 1 | Petosiris borrowed 248 drachmae and [à] artabae of barley from Harpocration. The conditions and provisions for the case that the loan should not be repaid are not entirely clear, but they include some kind of antichretic arrangement. In any case the loan was repaid, since it is crossed out.
