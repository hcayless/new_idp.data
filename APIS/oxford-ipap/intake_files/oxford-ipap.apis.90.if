cu520 | 1 | A petition in which Aurelia Tales, daughter of Palemon and wife of Isidorus, requests the praepositus of the fifth pagus to take action against the brothers of her brother-in-law in the interest of the latter's children.  On the death of her father, Tales and her sister Koulilla had inherited land which they divided between them. Koulilla's subsequent marriage to Aion produced two daughters, who were left orphans at an early age by the death of both parents. The father's brothers are now charged with showing indifference to the duties of guardianship by their neglect of the land inherited by their neices. Tales asks that this situation be rectified.
