cu520 | 1 | Philinos asks Zenon to receive from Herakleides 250 artabs of wheat and 300 of barley, and also the corn which he bought in partnership with Philinos for 100 drachmae, whatever the amount was; and he is to keep these quantities together in order that they may give the barley to Artemidoros and keep the wheat. Zenon is requested to choose corn of as good quality as possible and send specimens to Philinos. He also is to give Dionysios an allowance of bread and wine for every day that he stays with him and to look after his comfort.
