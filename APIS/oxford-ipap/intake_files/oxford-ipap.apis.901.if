cu520 | 1 | Dionysios proposes to rent from Zenon the young she-goats which are now with Demetrios and which Zenon lately saw beside the temple of Zeus and also 25 of the 125 which are with Menodoros.  For the latter he will pay as rent one kid per head so long as they remain as they are now, but the former he will guarantee against death (that is, he will replace any that die) besides paying the above rent. Ten other females from among the male goats in Philadelphia will bring the total up to sixty. He is ready to give Zenon the necessary security for these.
