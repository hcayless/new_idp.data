cu520 | 1 | The writer had previously addressed a letter to Kriton the stolarch asking him to obtain a lodging for him in Philadelphia and to do something for his messenger Herakleides.  But as he may have arrived before Kriton, he now sends Zenon a copy of the letter and asks him to be good enough to provide the lodging at once.
