cu520 | 1 | The letter is the sequel to the legal proceedings described in P.Oxy. I 37. It was written probably a few months after the latter, by the husband of the nurse Saraeus to the praefect, complaining that Pesouris (or, as he is called here, Syrus) refused to comply with the judgement of the strategus as there recorded. The papyrus is written in a very cursive hand.
