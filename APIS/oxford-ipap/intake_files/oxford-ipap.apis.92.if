cu520 | 1 | A petition submitted by Isidorus, son of Ptolemaeus, to the logistes, or curator, of the Arsinoite nome, complaining that a certain Melas and shepherds in his employ have grazed sheep over one aroura of his land.  Isidorus had submitted a petition to the same effect several days earlier. He has meanwhile learned that Melas and his party have on their part filed a complaint against him, and he therefore renews his own complaint against them. Since, as he alleges, this is not the first time his interests have been damaged by Melas, he appears to the logistes for protection and justice in accordance with the laws.
