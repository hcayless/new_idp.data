cu520 | 1 | Kleon had been meaning to send for some pigs to sell and had spoken to Damis suggesting that (as he himself was starting on a journey and had no messenger free) the latter should write to Zenon and ask whether he was to buy for him too.  Damis replied that he would wait till Kleon came back and buy for Zenon and himself in common. Kleon had now returned and had put at his disposal 59 pigs at the current price of 4 drachmae and half an obol each. He has written to keep Zenon informed.
