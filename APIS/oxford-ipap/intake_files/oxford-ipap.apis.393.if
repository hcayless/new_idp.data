cu520 | 1 | On the recto, five lines of large writing, reproducing a protocol similar to those which have appeared earlier, notably 67151. It is however less stylised, and therefore more legible, and would function as a valuable aid to the decipherment of such scripts, if only it were not in such a hopeless state of conservation. It consists of several small fragments, which could be re-arranged thanks to the verso. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
