cu520 | 1 | A request to an amphodogrammateus of the city for the registration of a boy aged three years and five months. The document is to be referred to the category of the notifications of birth, of which several examples from the Fayum have been published. ThereThere are, however, considerable differences in formula, the most obvious being the concurrence of the owner of the house, where the boy was to be registered, with the boy's father in presenting the application. On the verso P.Oxy. X 1287.
