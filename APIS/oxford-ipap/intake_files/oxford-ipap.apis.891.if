cu520 | 1 | Glaukias writes that he has not yet been able to settle up about the sesame and croton, owing to the absence of Apollonios the manager of the oil factory, but now that the latter has returned he hopes to arrange the matter immediately.  With regard to the stolen property (?) he has received a letter from Phanias authorising him to recover it; but as Chairon would not give it up until the arrival of Ammonios, he has not yet delivered the letter; as Ammonios however has now arrived, he is trying to recover it through him. He (Chairon?) likewise promised to give back the Chian wine. With regard to the calves Zenon knows what has taken place.
