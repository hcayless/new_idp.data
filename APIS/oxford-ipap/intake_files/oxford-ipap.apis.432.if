cu520 | 1 | Fragment of a draft of a petition to the emperor. The surface of the papyrus has disappeared in many places, and consequently, reconstruction of what remains is impossible. Anonymous complaint against a man who has deprived him of his fortune. Probably the hand is that of Dioscoros. The text continues on the verso. It seems that the applicant asks for a stipend taken from the annona of the Hermopolite nome. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
