cu520 | 1 | Petobastis, probably a farmer employed by Zenon, had been arrested by Hermaphilos the oikonomos for some reason not clearly stated.  Hermaphilos refused to liberate him unless he received a request from Zenon, who appears to have taken little interest in the matter and to have done nothing in answer to Petobastis' previous appeals. Petobastis now sends a messenger to find him and get a letter from him to Hermaphilos, and he begs him to write at the same time to Python and Antipatros asking them to speak to the oikonomos when the letter is delivered.
