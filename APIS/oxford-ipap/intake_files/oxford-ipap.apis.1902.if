cu520 | 1 | On the recto of this papyrus are two columns of which the first contains an account closely resembling the final column of P.Oxy. XVI 1911. It is cast in the same shape, mentions the same embolator and banker, and evidently relates to the same 5th indiction, the exact year being referred to on the verso; the amounts however are different, so that presumably different estates were concerned. The verso is P.Oxy. XVI 1915.
