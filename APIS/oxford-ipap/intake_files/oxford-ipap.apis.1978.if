cu520 | 1 | The text is in a very bad state of conservation. The guild of weavers of Philadelphia, which only comprises 12 members, are concerned because 4 of them have been assigned the liturgy of epiplous. As they have received a large order for clothes from the state, and expect still more to come, they petition the strategus asking that they should no longer be charged with public duties, in order that they could deliver their orders on time.
