cu520 | 1 | Paris, an employee of Zenon, says that he has already written about the same matters without receiving an answer and he would now like to know to whom he is to deliver the yoke of cattle and the harness and where he is to get the money to pay the informer about Gastron, who stole the tow, as well as the extra sum which he has spent on the tow-pickers. Moreover he himself is ill and has no money for private expenses. If Zenon goes away without giving an order, where is he to get the money?
