cu520 | 1 | Apollonios writes to Zenon on the subject of certain vineyards which formed part of his dürea in the Memphite nome, but which certain cleruchs there claimed as their property.  The case had been sent for trial before a judge called Krataimenes.  Apparently the cleruchs failed to put in an appearance, and in consequence of this Apollonios had written two letters, of which he sends copies to Zenon for guidance. One is addressed to Krataimenes, asking him to give an order that the crop whould be kept under watch, and the other is to Paramonos, perhaps an overseer of the memphite dürea, instructing him to see that the crop is kept safe after being gathered in. It can be inferred that the judge had not yet given a definite decision and that the trial had been postponed owing to the absence of the cleruchs.
