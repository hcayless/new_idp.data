cu518 | 1 | Kharabet el Gerza (ancient Philadelphia)
cu520 | 1 | The loquacious writer, whose name is lost, speaks in the first part of the letter about an expert who had been called in to cure dice made of gazelles' bones and who according to his own story had been employed by members of the Court, including Antipatros the Etesian. In the second part he tells about a dispute between Patron the captain of a merchant vessel and a trader or commercial agent called Apollophanes. The letter was probably written in Alexandria, shortly after Zenon had started on a voyage, and it evidently belongs to the early years of the correspondence.
