cu520 | 1 | This receipt consists of two parts.  In lines 1 - 3 Isidorus, son of Ptolemaeus, in his capacity of kephalaiotes is credited with delivery to a bakery, presumably military, of an unspecified quantity of emmer entrusted to him by the sitologoi.  The delivery includes both current dues and arrears. Lines 4-5 have a similar acknowledgment of delivery by Heroninus, also in his capacity of kephalaiotes.
