cu520 | 1 | After the usual protocol, the contract states tht Iason has leased out for two years to Demetrios and Limnaios 144 goats at an annual rent of 216 six-month-old kids.  The rent is to be paid half-yearly.  If they deliver less than the specified number of kids, they must pay at once a penalty price of ten drachmae per head; and at the end of the lease, if they fail to return the goats as they received them, they have to pay a certain sum for each one not accounted for. On the other hand, if Iason takes the herd from them before the agreed time, he must pay them a fine of one hundred drachmae. After the usual penalty clause authorising Iason to make exaction in case of default come the names of two sureties and six witnesses.
