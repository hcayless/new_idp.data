cu520 | 1 | This extract from an official survey list preserved in the public archives has been hastily copied on the back of P.Oxy. X 1267. Two entries have been extracted, both concerned with Diogenes who is described as a charioteer. Owing partly to their highly abbreviated character, partly to illegibility in the writing, there is some obscurity in the details.
