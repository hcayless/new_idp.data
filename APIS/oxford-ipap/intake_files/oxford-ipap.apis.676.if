cu520 | 1 | Diotimos had sent word to Demetrios to give certain large jars to a messenger from Zenon, to enable him to receive the price for the month of Phaophi.  Zenon had sent the messenger, and 410 jars had been handed over to him.  Demetrios now asks Zenon to send him the money or, if not all of it, at least half. As the price of the jars was twenty drachmae for twelve, the sum due was 683 drachmae, 2 obols.
