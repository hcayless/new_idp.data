cu520 | 1 | This account relating to land at a village called Pempo is on the verso of P.Oxy. XVI 1914, and was written probably soon after the year 555-6 which is mentioned in l.16. The land was of a peculiar kind which owing to the unfortunate mutilation of the heading is not quite clear. It is described as imperial property, but was or had been connected in some way with Fl. Apion II, whose schedule of dues from it was utilized for the present document. Alterations in the text as well as the fact that the account is written on a verso point to its being a draft only.
