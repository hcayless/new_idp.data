cu520 | 1 | Kollouthes writes that after leaving Zenon he found that the peasants belonging to the land which had been portioned out among the soldiers had fled to the temple of Isis in the Memphite nome.  So at the time when he received Zenon's letter he was setting out for Krokodilopolis to ask Maimachos the monarch to rout them out; and as soon as this is done he will come to Zenon.
