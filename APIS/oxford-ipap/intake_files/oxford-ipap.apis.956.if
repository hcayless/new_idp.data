cu520 | 1 | Paapis had made some request about a house which he had built and in accordance with Zenon's orders he now gives a statement of the expenses.  It was evidently a very small house made of mud bricks; the floor was probably of stamped mud and the roof of mud-plastered reeds supported on palm-wood rafters; the window would be either a shutter or a wooden grating, and there was no doubt a wooden door. The two chief items of expense were the cost of the bricks and the cost of transporting them by donkey from the brick-field.
