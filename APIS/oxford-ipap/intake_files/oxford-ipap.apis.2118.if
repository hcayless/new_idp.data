cu520 | 1 | Aurelios Heracles, by order of the decaprotoi of the Ano Toparchia of Oxyrhynchus, was imprisoned for having delayed the payment of taxes on a plot of land. He claims however that the plot of land in question is neither his by inheritence, nor is he the cultivator or the tenant. He therefore demands that the beneficiarius grant him his freedom.
