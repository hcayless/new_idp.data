cu520 | 1 | Protarchos writes that, as Zenon had promised to send them a quantity of natron, they had ordered none themselves and the supply in the nome being finished they were obliged to travel about and obtain what they could from other nomes. He asks Zenon therefore to send for the natron at once, in order that the linen-cleaners may be able to continue their work.
