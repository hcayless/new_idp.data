cu520 | 1 | This letter belongs to the time when Zenon was attached to the household of the dioiketes.  Simon states that he has sent Apollonios a jar of mackerel, and he asks Zenon to present them at a favourable moment, taking them out of the jar and displaying them on a platter. In return he begs Zenon to write to him if ever he is in need of his services.
