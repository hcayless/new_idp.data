cu520 | 1 | The recto of this papyrus contains the ends of eleven lines from an official register of persons, drawn up, to judge from the handwriting, towards the close of the 2nd century. A census and epikephalaia are mentioned, and the document no doubt had reference to taxation. On the verso is the upper part of a column, with some letters from the ends of lines of the preceding column, from an apparently unknown romance. This is written in a medium-sized irregular hand, employing for the most part uncial forms but with a tendency to cursive; it is not likely to be later than about the middle of the 3rd century.
