cu520 | 1 | Kriton complains about a certain person who had been billeted on him in order to carry out some work.  Up till now he had done nothing.  But, while Kriton was sleeping in the fields, he proceeded to drive the sow out of the courtyard, rousing up Kriton's wife by threatening to hamstring the beast and calling provocatively on Kriton himself, whom he supposed to be indoors. The wife told all this to Kriton on his return, but he had reported it to no one, waiting until the time required for the work should have passed; and meanwhile he kept the sow out of the courtyard. He now appeals to Zenon in the name of the Brother Gods and the king to finish his affair and not allow him to be insulted any longer, swearing by the genius of the king and by Berenike that he had not received from the fellow so much as one brick.
