cu520 | 1 | The value of this text lies in its geographical information about the villages of the Heracleopolite nome.  Since many of the names are known to be of villages in the Koéte toparchy, it is probable that the list is confined to that toparchy.  The recto contains parts of three columns of official account in which the name of the village precedes the name of the individual payer. The verso was re-used for a tax account of sums (in money?) arranged by villages.
