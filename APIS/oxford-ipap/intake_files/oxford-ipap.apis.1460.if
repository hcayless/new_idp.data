cu520 | 1 | Author and subject of this fragment remain obscure. Several phrases refer to architectural details, and the presence of verbs in the future tense is noticeable. One might be tempted to regard this piece as a specification for a temple still to be erected, but the question in l. 16 points to a work like the Eikones of Philostratus of Lemnos. The length of the line is undetermined, but it appears to be considerable. On the verso are remains of an account of artabae.
