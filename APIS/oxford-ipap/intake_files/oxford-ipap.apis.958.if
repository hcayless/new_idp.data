cu520 | 1 | Pathiophis, one of Zenon's farmers, pleads with his employer to release his wife from prison, as she is wearing out her heart over her children and he himself is unable to attend to his work.  Let him take pity on them this time; and if ever he finds them doing the like again, they will ask no mercy.
