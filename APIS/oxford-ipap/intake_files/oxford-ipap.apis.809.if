cu520 | 1 | An account drawn up by Hermias, a goatherd.  He leased a large number of goats from Zenon, paying him a yearly rent of four obols and one kid for each goat.  The remaining kids became his own property, which he could dispose of as he pleased, and he sold for his own profit the milk and cheese obtained from the goats, and perhaps also the hair, which was used for making a coarse cloth. The balance in his favour is ten drachmae.
