cu520 | 1 | Eudemos writes that he cannot leave his work, being busy with the harvest and with the wild oxen, but he has sent Theodora with the grey chiton which Zenon had ordered.  He asks Zenon to write to Philon requesting him to reduce the rent, as fifteen aroura of the crop are worm-eaten. He asks him also to exact the rent of the sheep from the Arabs, who are keeping possession of the wool as well as of the sheep; he adds that he will make Ptolemaios answer before Zenon for certain sheep which he has failed to return.
