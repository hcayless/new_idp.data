cu520 | 1 | A petition, preserved in two badly damaged copies, addressed to Aurelius Antonius, governor of Aegyptus Herculia, by Isidorus, son of Ptolemaeus.  In the year 314/315 Isidorus leased 25 arouras on half shares from the brothers Castor and Ammonianus.  By the terms of the lease, he supplied seed on loan, saw to the cultivation of the land, hired oxen for plowing, and paid the wages of the harvesters. In addition to fulfilling these contractual obligations, he made loans to the lessors in money and kind, and some of these were put into writing but not all of them. After the harvest the brothers appropriated the entire crop and refused to make a settlement with Isidorus, who thereupon reported their delinquency to the strategos and prapositus pagi, and finally on December 27th, 315, appeled to the praeses Aegypti Herculiai for redress. The story has a sequel in Isid.76.
