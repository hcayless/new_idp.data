cu520 | 1 | Official minutes of a juridicial act agreed before the praeses of Thebaid: Theodosius, courier of the officium, grants discharge of a debt of 15 golden coins 1/3 to the heirs of a certain Isidorus, who had performed the same function, notably to a woman named Theus - the widow of Isidorus. The payment is effected by Psoios, numerarius of the same officium, who had stood as guarantor for Isodorus at the time of the borrowing. It is still possible that that this numerarius had simply enough to extinguish the debt on the sum that he was given responsibility for paying to Isidorus, and which he had died without having received. Theodosius, finally, withdraws all rights to the possession of a house which had belonged to the deceased, and which had, it seems, been mortgaged in guarantee of the debt. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
