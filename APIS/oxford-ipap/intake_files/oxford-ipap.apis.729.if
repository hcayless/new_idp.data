cu518 | 1 | Kharabet el Gerza (ancient Philadelphia)
cu520 | 1 | Philiskos, the present oikonomos of the Arsinoite province, writes that he had been about to set out for Philadelphia when a letter arrived ordering him to go to Ptolemais to meet Ariston, a member of the Court, who had sailed up to see the  nome; but he expects to be with Zenon on the 17th. He asks him therefore to send Hedylos to Krokodilopolis in order that they may draw up a form of contract and then put the work up to tender in Philadelphia. He also tells Zenon to inform him whether he has received the mattocks from the Herakleopolite nome.
