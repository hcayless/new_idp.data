cu520 | 1 | This letter is addressed to Sabinus, the son of Gemellus, by a brother named Harpocration, of whom we have not before heard.  The  most interesting point in it is a mention of a Jew called Teuphilus (Theophilus), who had apparently been chosen as a cultivator of the domain-lands, and wished to be released from this service.
