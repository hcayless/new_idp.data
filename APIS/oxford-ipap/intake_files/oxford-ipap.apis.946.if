cu518 | 1 | Kharabet el Gerza (ancient Philadelphia)
cu520 | 1 | Zenon had ordered the bee-keepers to send their donkeys to Philadelphia to work for ten days, and they complain that he has kept them eighteen days and they have no donkeys to carry back their hives from the pastures.  The farmers are now warning them that they are going to release the water and burn the brushwood, so unless the donkeys come at once, the hives will be ruined and the king will lose much revenue. They promise to come back with the donkeys as soon as they have removed the hives.
