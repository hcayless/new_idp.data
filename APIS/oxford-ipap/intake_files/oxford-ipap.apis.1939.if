cu520 | 1 | Copy of accounts, rendered by various minor officials and others, of corn transported from a number of villages in the months of Epeiph and Mesore. The corn is commonly described as 'of the first delivery'; in one or two entries it is stated to be for the embole, and that may have been its destination in some, though not all, other cases. Presumably the various places concerned formed part of a single estate. In the last two accounts the items of corn are coupled with amounts in carats, which are much too small to be the equivalent value, and may represent costs of carriage.
