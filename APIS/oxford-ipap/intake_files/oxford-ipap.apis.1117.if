cu520 | 1 | A petition from a head clerk.  He wishes to have an office built for him near Zenon's, to be provided with a sufficient quantity of papyrus, a hundred rolls to begin with, and to have a definite arrangement about the salaries of himself and the three clerks who worked under him. From the figures given in column 3 it appears that an ordinary clerk earned little more than an unskilled labourer.
