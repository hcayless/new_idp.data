cu520 | 1 | A declaration in which Petesuchos gives surety to the centurion for the appearance of the woman Taphamounis against whom procedings were pending.  If Petesuchos does not produce her at a date fixed by the centurion he will be bound to pay eight and a half artabae of good wheat - the sum probably representing the debt owing by Taphamounis.
