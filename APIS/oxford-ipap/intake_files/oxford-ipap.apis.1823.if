cu520 | 1 | A well preserved petition to Aemilius Rusticianus, an otherwise unknown deputy-praefect, from two comarchs on behalf of the village of Paèmis. Their complaint was concerned with the repair of an embankment, and illustrates the difficulties experienced in in carrying out the regulations which had been laid down a few years previously by the dioecetes in P.Oxy. XII 1409.
