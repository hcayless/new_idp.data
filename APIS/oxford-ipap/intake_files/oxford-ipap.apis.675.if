cu520 | 1 | The writer gives Zenon some instructions about a house which was being built for him.  As the courtyard was too small and a stable had not been included, the architect at his request was going to increase the length of the site by twenty cubits.  He asks Zenon to give orders to this effect and to begin work at once. They will not be delayed by lack of wood. The architect has been ordered to leave a space for a garden round the house and to change the position of the gateway and bakery.
