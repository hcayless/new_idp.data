cu520 | 1 | A receipt addressed to the heirs of Fl. Apion for 371 artabae of wheat paid as an offering to a hospital. The steward of the hospital, who issued the receipt, was also a notary in the service of the Apion family. Whether this duplication of function was accidental, or due to any special connection between the hospital, who bore the name of Abbot Elias, and Fl. Apion, cannot be determined.
