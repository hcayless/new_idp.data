cu520 | 1 | Amyntas writes about his friend Demetrios, to who he had lately lent some silver plate belonging to Apollonios, and who in the meantime had been arrested.  If Demetrios' goods are being confiscated by the Treasury, Zenon must try to recover the plate; if not, he is requested to let Demetrios keep it. Amyntas also asks him to show Demetrios as much consideration as possible, until he himself finds an opportunity of interceding with Apollonios. (A fuller account of this affair appears in PCZ.59044.)
