cu520 | 1 | Demetrios, a farmer of the apomoira, tells Zenon, who seems to have had a financial interest in the farm, that he has sent him the accounts of the proceeds of the vineyards in the Themistou and the Polemünos, but that he has not yet received the accounts of the rest of the nome from his assistants. He asks him after going through the accounts to send them back in order that he may complete them.
