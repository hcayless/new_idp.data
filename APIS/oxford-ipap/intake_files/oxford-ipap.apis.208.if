cu520 | 1 | Eulogia and her daughter Rhodous have been sold to a certain Ioannes, a financial employee (trakteutäs). Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros. Crumbling, and very incomplete. This papyrus was found crumpled inside another roll, being used as stuffing, hence its very fragmentary state. In addition, various fragments (especially signatures) were found in the same roll, very damaged; the first three may form part of the same document.
