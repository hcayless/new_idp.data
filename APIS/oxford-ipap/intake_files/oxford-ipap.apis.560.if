cu520 | 1 | Krotos  complains that Alexis has taken no steps with regard to the judgment given against the persons who sailed in charge of the oil, neither repaying the money nor handing over the slave girl whom they had offered as security.  Moreover he has let Theron, the sailor from the kubaia, escape from prison and disappear from sight.
