cu520 | 1 | This draft deals with the same subject as PCZ.IV.59620, being in fact another draft of the same petition.  At the end the writer asks the king to order Agenor to examine the case and, if Arsinoe is unable to produce witnesses to show that she built the house, to decide in favour of the petitioner. But he has modified this sentence in a long interpolation or correction, in which he asks that, as he too is without witnesses, the strategos should hear the case anew and decide who seems right. The position at present was that Agenor had ordered Zenon to produce his witnesses or else leave Arsinoe in possession; and Zenon protests that, though the defection of Eutychos had deprived him of some essential evidence, it was not fair that Arsinoe should gain her suit without being called upon to show proof. In both drafts stress is laid upon Arsinoe's assertion, contradicted by Zenon, that he had definitely undertaken to produce the builders as witnesses.
