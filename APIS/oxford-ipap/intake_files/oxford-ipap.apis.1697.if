cu520 | 1 | Declaration on oath made by Aurelius Pambechis to the chief of the treasury of Oxyrhynchus, ensuring the latter against any loss or annoyance which he might incur by becoming surety for Pambechis on his appointment to succeed to a subordinate official post. Some guarantee, perhaps that of a public officer, was no doubt a condition of the appointment required by law. The object of the law was therefore practically defeated by this private arrangement by which the person giving the necessary security was himself secured by the person to whom it was given against any posssible loss.
