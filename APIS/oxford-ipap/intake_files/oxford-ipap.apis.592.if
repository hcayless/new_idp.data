cu520 | 1 | The first part of the letter is about Patron, the captain of a boat which was cruising between Alexandria and Apollonios' temporary place of residence.  Amyntas has heard that Patron is accustomed to excuse himself when he arrives late by saying that he has been retarded by Amyntas not giving him the letters in good time. The next sentence is mutilated and rather mysterious; it may perhaps mean that Amyntas did not care to write to Apollonios because he was not sure whether the latter knew of what was really going on. The letter ends with a list of the provisions which Amyntas has sent from Alexandria.
