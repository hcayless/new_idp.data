cu520 | 1 | A contract for the cession of 1/3 aroura of corn-land at Seryphis, a village in the Western toparchy, from Aurelius Serenus also called Sarapion, in return for 400 drachmae. This is the first clear example from Oxyrhynchus of a 3rd century cession as distinct from a sale. The land is not stated to have been catoecic, but since it formed part of a cleros it may have belonged to that category. In place of the usual signature of the person ceding the land there is the signature of the other party, acknowledging the cession, which is here called a katagraphä.
