cu520 | 1 | On the recto, remains of three columns, only the middle of which is complete, containing lists of names. The verso contains a copy of the proceedings of a hearing before the strategus. The document is complete, but very damaged. The subject is a weaver who was unjustly assigned a liturgy and who now demands to be exempted from it. The strategus asks him to nominate someone else instead, and it seems that the plaintiff was successful.
