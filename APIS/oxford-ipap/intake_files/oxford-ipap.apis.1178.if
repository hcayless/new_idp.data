cu520 | 1 | An account of barley given out for the feeding of pigs, donkeys, horses, dogs and pigeons, the measure employed being the anälütikon, in which the artab contained forty choinikes.  Two of the pigs were Sicilian; this was a famous breed in antiquity, and no doubt the presence of these imported specimens at Philadelphia was due to Apollonios. Column 5 shows us that the dogs in Zenon's charge were well cared for.
