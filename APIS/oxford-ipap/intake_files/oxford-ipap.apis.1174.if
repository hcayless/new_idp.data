cu520 | 1 | An account of daily expenses during a cruise.  At the top is a list of the nomes between Memphis and Hermopolis; then comes an account of three days' expenses; and below is a further list of provisions, the cost of which is to be divided among four people probably the crew of the boat. On the margin and on the verso are some slight sketches of human figures and other subjects. The best of them represents a man or an Apollo holding a lyre of fifteen strings, which ends below in animals' heads and has a loop round one of its sides.
