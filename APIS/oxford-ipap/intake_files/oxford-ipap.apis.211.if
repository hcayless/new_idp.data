cu520 | 1 | Fl. Victor, priest of the Church of Aphrodito, and Fl. Apollos, both originating from the village of Aphrodito, but now residing at Constantinople, acknowledge the receipt from the banker Anastasios of the sum of 20 gold coins, which they undertake to return to him after a delay of four months, with the legal interest (8%) in the branch of his bank in Alexandria. In several pieces. The fragments of the beginning are very mutilated: they were found far from the remainder, from which they differ by colour as much as by state of conservation. Nevertheless the connection of lines 31 and 32 is certain. The left margin is very irregularly torn. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
