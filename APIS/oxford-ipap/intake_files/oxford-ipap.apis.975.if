cu520 | 1 | Pettukamis, a potter from Hiera Nesos, says that Zenon knows by experience whether or not he is an able workman.  But if he is to be employed, he must have such assistants as will be useful to him.  As an additional aid he proposes to engage Paesis and his sons, for he thinks highly of them and they are well acquainted with the ground. They must begin in the month of Thoth, in order that the work may be finished in good time and prove useful. He ends by asking to be shown the place in which he is to work.
