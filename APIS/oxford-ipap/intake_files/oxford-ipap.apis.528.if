cu520 | 1 | This letter introduces Zopyros the son of Sosigenes, who, like Zenon, belonged to a Kaunian family, and requests Zenon to choose a favourable moment for presenting him to Apollonios, to whom he wished to speak about some private matters.  Amyntas had also written a letter of recommendation to Apollonios (PCZ.59046), which would probably be delivered by Zenon or by Zopyros himself.
