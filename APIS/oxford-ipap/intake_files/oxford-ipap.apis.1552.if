cu520 | 1 | A petition to Ptolemy (Euergetes) from Antigonus, probably a phylacites, complaining that Patron, the archiphylacites of the lower toparchy of the Oxyrhynchite nome, had prevented him from carrying out his duties, and asking for redress.  P.Hibeh.I.073 is a letter from Antigonus on the same subject to Dorion, the epistates. Both documents are mutilated, but they supplement each other, and the sequence of events is clear. Callidromus, a Cyrenean settler, had obtained unlawful possession of a donkey belonging to a certain Dorion, and Antigonus has been directed by Dorion the epistates to compel Callidromus either to restore the animal to its owner or to pay its value. Antigonus accordingly arrested Callidromus and lodged him in a prison at the village of Sinaru. Patron then intervened, and not only released Callidromus from prison but himself took possession of the donkey.
