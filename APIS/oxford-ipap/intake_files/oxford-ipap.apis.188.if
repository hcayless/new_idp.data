cu518 | 1 | Aphrodites kome (Antaiopolites)
cu520 | 1 | Two fragments of a petition (libelloi) addressed to Fl. Victor, riparios of the village  of Aphrodito, by the farm worker Aurelius Victor. Only the beginning and the end remain. The middle, which contained the explanation of the matter, has disappeared. Victor, son of Besios, who is here accused, is perhaps the same who wrote 67091. In this case he would, in the interval, have left the service. Subscription on the verso. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
