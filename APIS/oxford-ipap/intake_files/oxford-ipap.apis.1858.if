cu520 | 1 | Conveyance of buildings and corn-land at Sesphtha, with a water-wheel, windlass, stone, etc. The price of the property, which had been inherited by the vendor from his parents, is not stated, and though it may have been given in the lost beginning, is more likely to have been the subject of a distinct contract of prasis.
