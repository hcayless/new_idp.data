cu520 | 1 | An imperial rescript addressed to the dux of the Thebaid, on the subject of Dioscoros. The plaintiff's father, having remarried, has made to his second wife a gift of the goods which constituted the dowry of the first - whose son, Dioscoros, has brought proceedings against his stepmother for the restitution of his inheritance. The Emperor commands the dux of Thebaid to reduce to just proportions the share of the second wife, in conformity with a law of King Leon the First, which is, in part, cited at the end of the papyrus. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
