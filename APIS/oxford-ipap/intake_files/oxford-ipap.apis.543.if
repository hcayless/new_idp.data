cu520 | 1 | This letter is about a boy called Pyrrhos, who was being educated in Alexandria and was in particular being trained to compete in the public games.  Zenon had written that they might train him if they were sure that he would win a prize, but that otherwise it would be a waste of money and would distract him from his studies. Hierokles replies that Ptolemaios the master of the palaestra is well pleased with the boy's progress and that they fully expect him to be successful. He asks Zenon to send him a number of articles required by Pyrrhos.
