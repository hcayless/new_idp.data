cu520 | 1 | Probably a continuation of PCZ.59029, in which Antimenes announced the departure of a lady, probably from Kaunos or some other Carian port.  The docket on the verso states that Antimenes has written about Doris and has added a copy of a letter received by him from Sosipatros. He now announces that Ariston and the sister, no doubt Doris, have arrived at Arsinoe after being compelled by stormy weather to put in at Patara, and he thanks Antimenes for the attention he has paid to the travellers.
