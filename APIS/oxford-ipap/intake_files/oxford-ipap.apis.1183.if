cu520 | 1 | A fragment of a corn account.  The entries, some of which are checked by slanting strokes and others by two cross strokes in the right margin, state the quantities of olyra and other grain that have been lent to certain persons, presumably for seed.  The loan is in some cases repayable in kind at the rate of 150 percent; in other cases the borrower has the option of repaying in kind at the said rate or of paying the price of the borrowed grain in money. An exception is made in favour of a donkey-driver, who is not required, if he elects to repay in kind, to return more than the amount which he borrowed.
