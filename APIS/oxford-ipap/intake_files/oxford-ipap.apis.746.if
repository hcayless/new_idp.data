cu520 | 1 | Zenon had told Sisouchos to see the potter about the jars.  If he wishes them to be done at once, he is to write to the potter in order that Sisouchos and the latter may come to him before the time slips away.  He has sent Zenon ten chamber-pots and asks him to write if ever he wants anything else.
