cu520 | 1 | Thamoys the swineherd complains that, while doing something to protect the pigs against the crocodiles, he had been assaulted by Psosnaus.  He is still laid up and has been obliged to hire a man to keep the pigs at their task of treading the corn, and he has sent the present letter by his wife. Zenon is requested to summon the aggressor and question the witnesses, so that justice may be done.
