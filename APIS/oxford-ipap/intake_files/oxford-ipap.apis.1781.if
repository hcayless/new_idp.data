cu520 | 1 | The chief point of interest in this letter, which was written by a man in financial difficulties, is the ratio given in ll. 31 sqq. between the current values of the gold solidus and the murias of drachmae or denarii. A date in the second half of the fourth century is suggested by the handwriting, and the great deprecation of the murias makes it probable that the century was nearing its close.
