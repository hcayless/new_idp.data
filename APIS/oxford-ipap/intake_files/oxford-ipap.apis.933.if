cu520 | 1 | Hippokrates accuses Nikanor of continually trying to injure him.  Putting aside the question whether the 1000 drachmae should be exacted from himself or his surety, Nikanor had no right to enter the house of a free-born woman, where Hippokrates happened to be living, and to put a seal on her possessions as if they were seizable for the debt. The lady will take steps to secure justice as soon as Hermaphilos the oikonomos returns. As for himself, let Nikanor insult him and hale him to prison, leaving his surety unmolested; he will try to defend himself; and he tells his oppressor plainly what he and all other people in the town think about his amiable character.
