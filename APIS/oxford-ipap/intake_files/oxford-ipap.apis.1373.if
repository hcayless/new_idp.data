cu520 | 1 | This letter was found with the Gemellus papyri, but the persons concerned were not so far as we know members of the family.  The letter is a strong remonstrance addressed by a relative or friend to a man who was defrauding his mother of some allowance (chorŠgia), and threatens prosecution if this conduct was persisted in.
