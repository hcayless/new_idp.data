cu520 | 1 | As this papyrus was found sticking to PCZ.59053, there is no doubt that it is the list of which Amyntas speaks at the end of that letter.  He was apparently to have the use of two boats, a kerkouros and a kubaia and for each boat he required a set of four ears that the two boats were of equal length, but the kubaia was broader throughout and blunter at the bow. Column 2 contains a list of miscellaneous articles, including a hundred and fifty papyrus rolls for accounts and correspondence.
