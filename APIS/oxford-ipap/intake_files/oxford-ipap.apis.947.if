cu520 | 1 | Molossos writes that Theogenes had come to Mendes with three bundles of flax, probably samples, and that they were fetching such and such a price.  The retail-dealers had assured him that it would be easy to dispose of 10,000 such bundles; hence he urges Zenon to begin at once sending as much as he can and to write to Promethion the local banker to lend a helping hand. Molossos had already written about the papyrus rolls and now he has sent a message through Kriton whom he met at the Delta; he hopes therefore to get word from Zenon what he is to do about them.
