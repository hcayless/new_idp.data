cu520 | 1 | A petition addressed to Dioscorus, praepositus of the fifth pagus, by Isidorus son of Ptolemaeus, who alleges that with much labour he had sown to wheat only seven out of the eighty arouras for which he had fiscal responsibility, but his pains went for nothing when the crop was consumed by animals which had been put out to graze in his field. He does not name the culprits because they have not yet been identified. He asks the praepositus to summon the local police officers and to set in motion the regular procedure of investigation and apprehension of wrongdoers.
