cu520 | 1 | The papyrus is preserved in six vertical strips, breaks occurring where the sheet was originally folded. On the right one or two more strips are missing. The hand is a large neat and rather carefully executed cursive. The extract comes from an edict which must have been one of the first that T. Haterius Nepos issued when he came in office
