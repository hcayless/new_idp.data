cu520 | 1 | Lower portion of a sheet, which was the uppermost of a quire, from a papyrus codex. The hand is a good example of the formal upright type commonly designated 'Coptic', and is of the 6th or 7th century. Stops in two positions (high and medial), accents, breathings, and marks of elision and quantity are fairly frequent; a few of these are evidently original, but the majority, which are more lightly written, are later additions, due probably to one of the correctors, of whom two, one using cursive forms, seem to be distinguishable. Besides these common signs a comma to separate words, and its converse, the sub-linear hyphen, occur among the subsequent insertions. The dimensions for the complete page may be estimated at about 34 x 19 cm.
