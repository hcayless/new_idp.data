cu520 | 1 | The writer, probably a cleruch, speaks of a piece of land which Zenon has leased from him and planted with vines.  He states that he has agreed to give half the rent to his sons, or to the sons of some other person, for their maintenance, and he asks Zenon to pay them their share directly, after deducting from the rent the amounts due for various taxes.
