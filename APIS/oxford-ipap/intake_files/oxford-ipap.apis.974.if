cu520 | 1 | The first document on the recto is an account of the sums received by Herieus the stone-cutter from Athyr to Pharmouthi and of the sums earned by him, the balance to his debit being 313 1/3 drachmae.  Then follows a memorandum to Zenon about the above account and about other sums owed by Herieus, who seems to have been a somewhat unscrupulous person. The verso contains a draft of a letter to Kleon and of another memorandum to Zenon on the subject of houses and of the conduct of a certain Pais. The text is so mutilated and the Greek is so extraordinarily bad that it is difficult to give a clear account of what Petosiris means to say.
