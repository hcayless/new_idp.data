cu520 | 1 | The girl called Satyra was harper in the Alexandrian household of Apollonios.  In the present letter, which is more emphatic than grammatical, she complains on behalf of herself and her mother that they have received  no dress allowance for more than a year and very little in the way of salary. In two other papyri (PCZ 59059 and 59087), we hear of her receiving opsünion and linen garments.
