cu520 | 1 | A letter probably from one of Zenon's Carian friends, in which he informs Apollonios, through Zenon, that letters had been sent from Apollodotos and Kratinos, son of Danaos, proposing that the affair of Danaos should be settled by the payment of twenty talents to the Crown, but that the bearer of the letters, instead of delivering them, was wasting his time in Alexandria in the house of Aristoboulos, He also reports that Danaos' friend Pankris was trying to obtain the office of nomophylax through Epikydes and that the question was being referred to Apollonios; and he advises the latter to show no favour to a man who was talking scandal about him. He next asks for letters of recommendation from Apollonios to Apollodotos, Laagos and Hikesios and for another letter to Iason the banker certifying that Apollonios had been appeased through the writer's intercession.
