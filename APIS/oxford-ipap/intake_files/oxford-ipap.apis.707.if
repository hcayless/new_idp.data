cu520 | 1 | A letter from Artemidoros the physician.  He had heard that the sons of Leptines in Pharbaithos, Nikandros and Myrikon, had a black horse with large swellings on the legs which rendered him useless except to breed from, and he asks Zenon to use his influence with the young men in order to procure him the horse, either buying him outright for a small sum or borrowing him for the breeding season, as his own stallion is rather old and wanting in vigour. He also reminds Zenon about the sesame on the kläros, asking him to see it harvested and inform him of the amount of the crop.
