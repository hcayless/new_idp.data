cu520 | 1 | Alarmed by the news that his father is planning to leave his village (anachürein), a son writes to a relative or a friend, asking him to intervene to deter the desertion, or at least to have him send a hundred drachmae, so that he himself could leave the Arsinoite nome and relocate to Alexandria, in order to avoid the abuse he would suffer because of his father's desertion. The choice of words and elegant phrasing, despite a few mistakes, give this text a certain literary tone.
