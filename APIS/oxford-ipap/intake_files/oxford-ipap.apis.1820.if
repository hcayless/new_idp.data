cu520 | 1 | This receipt, issued by a sitologus in the reign of Claudius,  for corn-dues of an unspecified character, differs somewhat from the stereotyped formula of this class of receipts from the reign of Domitian onwards. The payer was a woman, not a tax-collector, and the dues were probably not rent of State lands, but land-tax on other kinds of land.
