cu518 | 1 | Oxyrhynchus
cu520 | 1 | Fragments containing discussion of matters connected with Alcman, Stesichorus, Sappho, Alcaeus, and quotations from all four. There is no particular reason to suppose that all the fragments come from the same roll; but whatever the intervals between the fragments, and whatever their relative order, it is hard to see any principle underlying the selection of topics and passages, - matters covered include the nationality of Alcman, a discussion concerning the beardless Agesidamus in one of his poems, Stesichorus' innovations in mythology, Sappho's relations with her brothers, whether Alcaeus was justly suspected of murder and on what occasion his brother died.
