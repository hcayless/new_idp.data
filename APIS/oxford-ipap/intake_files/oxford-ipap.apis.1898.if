cu520 | 1 | The recto of this papyrus contains (written over an earlier text, which has been washed out) a calculation of the amounts to be remitted in consequence of a reduction of one-fourth in the embole, gold taxes, and other dues. There is no statement of the year, nor of the area from which the dues came, but the amounts involved are fairly large. The main points of interest are the equivalences given between the cancellus artaba and the solidus, and between the solidus of refined metal and the Alexandrian solidus. On the verso are six more lines, giving further conversions of artabae of corn into solidi on the Alexandrian standard.
