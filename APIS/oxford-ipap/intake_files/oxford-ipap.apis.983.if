cu518 | 1 | Kharabet el Gerza (ancient Philadelphia)
cu520 | 1 | Somoelis, the Jewish guard of the granary at Philadelphia, reports that he has sown a certain piece of land and that he is therefore entering in his account with Zenon twenty artabs of wheat for the sowing.  He complains of being oppressed by Etearchos and begs Zenon to write and ask him to be more considerate, and he offers to buy him 1000 artabs of barley from the cavalrymen. If possible, he would like to have an additional granary, the present one not being large enough to hold this year's crop. For guarding the granary there he receives nothing except an artab and a half of wheat per month given him by the inhabitants of Philadelphia, a pittance which does not even suffice to feed his children, unless he himself earns something extra.
