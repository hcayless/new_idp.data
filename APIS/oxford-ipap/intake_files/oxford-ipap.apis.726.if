cu520 | 1 | Hermon had written that he was sending Zenon a certain number of logs and olive shoots and he now adds that, after the first letter was written, both consignments had been increased.  Among the logs are seven shoots which it is doubtful if Zenon will accept. If he likes them, he is to write and Hermon will send another consignment of them. The letter ends with a request for more money.
