cu518 | 1 | Aphrodites kome (Antaiopolites)
cu520 | 1 | Register containing a series of  guarantees (egguai), delivered to the riparios Apollos, and almost all dated the same day. This papyrus supplies us with fairly complete details on the role and the organization of the rural police of the poimenes kai agrophulakes. They must watch over the irrigation of the fields, generally attend to all sorts of public works not specified here, maintain order, seek out and make appear in court people who have been called to justice. Also worth noting is the division of the territory of the kome into decanies, each of which has its own guard. That of Teiae is cited twice. It has at least three poimenes; also that of Phenneus is named on two occasions. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
