cu520 | 1 | A petition submitted by Isidorus, son of Ptolemeaus, to Aurelius Gerontius, praepositus of the fifth pagus of the Arsinoite nome.  It cites an earlier petition submitted by Isidorus to Valerius Ziper, praeses of Aegyptus Herculia.  In the month Phamenoth (Feb/March) of the year 315/316, Isidorus made a loan to Castor and his brother Ammonianus of 32 artabas of wheat and 18 artabas of phaselus beans. As security for the loan, the brothers pledged three oxen, and the brother-in-law Tomis assumed responsibility for the eventual transfer of the the oxen to Isidorus if the debt were not paid in Pauni of the same year. Subsequently, Castor died and Ammonianus found it convenient to disappear. Their property came into the hands of Tomis and his brother Demetrius, who also failed to meet the debt. Isidorus then addressed a petition to Valerius Ziper, praeses of Aegyptus Herculia, on April 13th 318, with the result that he was directed to present his complaint to the praepositus pagi.
