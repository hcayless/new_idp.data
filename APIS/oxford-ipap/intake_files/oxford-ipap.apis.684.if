cu520 | 1 | Zenon has done right to arrest the treasurer attached to the beer-house.  Apollonios has sent Amenneus the brewer to Philadelphia in order that the treasurer may be confronted with him and convict him of the charges which he has brought against him.  The case is to be tried before Peton the chrematistes, who is coming specially for this and for another affair (see PCZ.59203 and 04). If Amenneus appears to have really spoken as reported, Apollonios threatens that he will have him hanged.
