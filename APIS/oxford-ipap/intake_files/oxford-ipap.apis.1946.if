cu520 | 1 | On the recto account in two columns of receipts in money from three villages, and of expenditure. On the verso two more columns recording receipts in corn from various individuals. The items of corn are stated in two kinds of artabae, metr(Ÿi) and an unnamed artaba, and totals are thrice given in artabae mikr(Ÿi) mevtr(Ÿi), which appears here for the first time; but how these totals, which seem quite inconsistent with the preceding figures, are arrived at is not apparent.
