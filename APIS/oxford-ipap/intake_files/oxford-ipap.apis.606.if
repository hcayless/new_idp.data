cu520 | 1 | In answer to Zenon's letter, Panakestor informs him that Iason has brought him a thousand drachmae in copper.  He asks Zenon to send him the salaries for three months and a supply of wine.  He would be glad if Zenon could find time to come and see to the work. He has already sent down 3600 artabs of barley and is now sending down the rest. He is short of papyrus and asks Zenon to send him some.
