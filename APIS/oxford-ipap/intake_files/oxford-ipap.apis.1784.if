cu520 | 1 | Fragment containing the beginnings of a few lines from the top of a column, written in round upright uncials of rather above the medium size, and evidently of an early date in the Roman period; they may be assigned to about the middle of the first century. Changes of speaker within a line are denoted by blank spaces within which the usual double dots are inserted, marginal paragraphi being also employed; and for the sake of greater clearness the names of the speakers have been added in small cursive letters, probably by a different and somewhat later hand, either in the margin or above the line.
