cu520 | 1 | Onnophris was one of the farmers or foremen whom Zenon employed to cultivate land and more especially such land as he had taken over from the neighbouring cleruchs.  He had asked Zenon for a cart and perhaps a camel to carry the crop on the holding of Ptolemaios, and he now presses his request. In the second part of the letter he speaks about work to be done on the land of Theopompos.
