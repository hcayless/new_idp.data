cu520 | 1 | Meieus had an action against Stachys, and Zenon had told him to have it tried in the town of the latter, apparently Krokodilopolis.  Meieus objects to this and demands that it should be tried in a town where both parties are strangers, such as Memphis or Herakleopolis. He adds that Pasis on hearing that the action against him was to be tried in Krokodilopolis has taken refuge in despair at the altar of the king.
