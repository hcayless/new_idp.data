cu520 | 1 | Statement showing that 960 pounds of meat had been distributed to 30 bucellarii and, apparently, a secretary. All the recipients are specified by name, and it is here that the interest of the document lies. Two have Germanic names,  two are described as Bessi, two more as from Salonae (in Dalmatia), and several others bearing names that are unusual. But to find foreigners serving as bucellarii in Egypt is normal at a time when the Imperial armies were largely recruited from barbarians. Some of these individuals recur in P.Oxy. XVI 2046.
