cu520 | 1 | Paosis, who  had been put under Zenon's protection by his father Horos, one of Apollonios' sailors, complains that Herakleides, headman of the Philadelphian estate, has put him in prison for the purpose of exacting a hundred drachmae from  him.  But he has no property except a donkey and some sheep which Horos left in his charge. So he begs Zenon to release him until he can communicate with Horos, who will petition Apollonios on his behalf.
