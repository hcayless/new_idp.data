cu520 | 1 | This list of the contents of Zenon's portmanteau was given or sent to him by Peisikles, and perhaps the clothes described in it were his outfit for one of his long journeys with Apollonios.  They are of various kinds and colours, both for summer and for winter, for indoors and outdoors, some new, some worn and others partly worn. Evidently the chlamys and chiton were the most important garments, as he possessed six of the former, and no less than eleven of the latter, two of them with long sleeves.
