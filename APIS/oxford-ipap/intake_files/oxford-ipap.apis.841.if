cu520 | 1 | Demetrios, one of the farmers of the apomoira in the Arsinoite  nome, sends Kriton, who like Zenon had probably a financial interest in the farm, a copy of the settlements which he has made for certain districts.  The account was written in the middle of summer, and the sums mentioned in it seem to be the assessed yield of the tax in various localities.
