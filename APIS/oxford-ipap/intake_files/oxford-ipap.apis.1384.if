cu520 | 1 | The recto of this papyrus contains parts of two columns of an account of legal proceedings(?) in a very mutilated condition.  On the verso is the beginning of a horoscope, of which only the name of the person was written and the date, given as usual by the two calendars, the 'Greek' (i.e the Julian) and the 'ancient' (in which there was no leap year). The date in question is Mesore 5 = Thoth 16 in the first year of Marcus and Verus (July 29th, A.D. 161)
