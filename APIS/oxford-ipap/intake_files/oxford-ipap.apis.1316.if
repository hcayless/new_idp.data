cu520 | 1 | Pechysios owes money to Neandros, and there is a contract which proves this. The contract had been given to a certain Pet[  ] for safe keeping, but he, in the meantime, has died, and the contract is now in the hands of his son Paos, who is refusing to return it. Neandros demands it back. The verso contains a summary of the petition.
