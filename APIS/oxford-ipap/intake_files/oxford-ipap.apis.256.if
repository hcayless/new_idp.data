cu520 | 1 | The biography was framed in a triple 'wavy' line. To the left were indicated the subdivisions of the work and the qualities which distinguish it. The fragment is not part of an edition of Isocrates, since the lines of the verso do not read in the same direction as those of the recto. The verso text is fragmentary at best. It must have been intended for use at school. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
