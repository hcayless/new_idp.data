cu520 | 1 | Formal notice written by a certain John, breaking off the engagement between his daughter Euphemia and his intended son-in-law, Phoebammon, on account of the latter's misconduct. The signature of the father,  in sloping uncials, is placed at the end. The document is not quite complete at the beginning, though not more than part of the date is lost; possibly line 1 is the original first line.
