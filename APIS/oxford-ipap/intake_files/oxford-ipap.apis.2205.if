cu520 | 1 | Aphrodous, with Heracleides as her kurios, sells part of a young donkey, which belonged to her deceased husband, to Didymion, son of Soterichus, who already owned another part. She acknowledges the receipt of the agreed payment. It is not clear whether the Soterichus mentioned in this document is the same Soterichus who figures in this archive. The verso is blank. The papyrus is broken at the lower end and has been abraded in several parts.
