cu520 | 1 | Apollonios orders Zenon to take at least 3000 olive shoots from his park and from the gardens at Memphis.  Before the fruit is gathered he is to mark each tree from which he intends to take shoots, and he is to choose above all the wild olive and the laurel, for the Egyptian olive is only suitable for parks and not for olive-groves.
