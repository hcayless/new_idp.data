cu520 | 1 | An account similar in character to the second parts of P.Oxy. XVI 1911 and 1912, to the former of which especially there are some close approximations, suggesting that the date of that document and of the present one are not far apart. It would be natural to infer from these verbal resemblances that the present account proceeds from the Apion archive, an inference which is confirmed by the local names and the references to 'our master the consul'. On the verso is P.Oxy. XVI 2037.
