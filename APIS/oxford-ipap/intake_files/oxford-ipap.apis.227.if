cu520 | 1 | Three private accounts, in the same hand.  The author sets out a list of people who have stolen from him a part of his property, as well as his animals. The recto bears the two first accounts, separated by a large empty space. The verso bears a third,  written at a right angle in relation to the verso, which proves that the papyrus is not a detached leaf from an account book. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
