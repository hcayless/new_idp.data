cu520 | 1 | Zoilos, who resided abroad, had been ordered by the god Sarapis to sail over to Alexandria and inform Apollonios of his decree that a temple should be built for him in the Greek quarter of the town where the writer lived.  Seeking to decline the task, Zoilos was overtaken by a dangerous illness, from which he escaped by promising to obey the god's bidding. Meanwhile a man from Knidos had arrived and started to build a Sarapieion on the chosen spot; but the god forbade him and he departed. When Zoilos eventually came to Alexandria, instead of communicating the message, he spoke to Apollonios about another affair, with the result that he had a long relapse. He now writes to Apollonios, who was travelling in the interior, relating the whole story and begging him to provide means for building the temple.
