cu520 | 1 | This document represents the will of Flavius Theodoros, employed in the offices of the dux of the Thebaid.  Cf. 67151, it is similar style, often the same phraseology, and has a long drawn out quality.  The document is incomplete. The testator, having no children, divides his fortune between three heirs: to the monastery of Saint Senouthios at Atripe, he leaves all his property located in the Hermopolite, Antinoite and Panopolite nomes or elsewhere, just as in the towns of Hermopolis and Antinoe, charging that the revenues from there be used for 'pious' works. To the convent of Apa Mousaios he leaves all his movable goods. To his grandmother he leaves an unspecified property. His slaves shall be freed. Two fragments, separated by a small lacuna (l. 78); the end is missing. The verso is occupied by a text in tachygraphic characters. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.
