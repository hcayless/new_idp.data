cu520 | 1 | Ptolemaios informs Zenon of the settlement made by Phanias the grammateus with the cavalrymen.  He has liberated their crops, but made them undertake in future to present their horses in good condition at the inspection.  Zenon may therefore send someone to take delivery of the sesame and the balance of barley owed by the cavalrymen, and he is requested to let Ptolemaios know whom he is sending.
