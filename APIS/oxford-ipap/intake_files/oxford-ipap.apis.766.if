cu520 | 1 | Hierokles, one of Zenon's Alexandrian correspondents, writes him a letter of recommendation on behalf of a certain Hermogenes who was coming as a cleruch to the Fayoum or to some neighbouring district.  If he is not stationed at Philadelphia, Zenon is requested to write to his commanding officer, wherever he may be. The letter was carried by Hermogenes himself and was not delivered till four months after the date on which it was written.
