cu300 | 1 | 1 ostracon.  5.3 x 5.5 cm.  Broken at top.
cu500 | 1 | 3 lines of text; two hands.
cu500 | 2 | This ostrakon should most likely be included in a dossier of Sarapion's orders (O.Ber. II 153-183).
cu500 | 3 | Line 4: cf. O.Ber. II 173, 177, 178 and 182.  Sabastos 24 should probably be restored, as these dates all seem to have been written on the same day and in the same hand.  They may be additions in Berenike at the moment when the passes were collected at the customs gate.
