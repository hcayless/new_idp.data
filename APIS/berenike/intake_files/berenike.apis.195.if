cu500_t | 1 | Herennius to Satornilus his dearest, greetings.  I certainly received your ostrakon.  Concerning the cats, Ourses is taking care of them in accordance with what I also wrote to you on another occasion.  And now look again, what do you think about the roses for 200 dr. and 180 dr., inquiring also about the transport costs?  If you she-donkey has got better, come by night, so that you may go down to get the transport money.  Do not be concerned about your wood.  If you find a good tree-trunk [by the finger?], I'll take it.  I sold . . . not having anywhere to put it (?) . . . Don't worry . . .
