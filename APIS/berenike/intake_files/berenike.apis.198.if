cu500_t | 1 | Capito to Netios his brother, greetings.  First of all I thought it necessary to greet you by letter.  Since you were not planning to go off for a lawsuit, I ask you, brother, to take care . . . a storage jar and a ladikenon jar for water, and . . .  You say that your brother is coming and together with you . . . so that we may settle together.  For I heard also that you are sailing in.  I was delighted, then, that he is coming with you.
