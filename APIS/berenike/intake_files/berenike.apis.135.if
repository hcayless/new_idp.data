cu300 | 1 | 2 fragments of the same papyrus, not joining.  (1) 7.1 x 5 cm.; (2) 10.5 x 6 cm.
cu500 | 1 | There are lists of names on both sides of the papyrus, perhaps 20 names on the front, depending on the reading of line 9 on the front of Fragment 2.
cu500 | 2 | The back apparently had a heading, no longer legible.  Its lower part included a list of female names, mostly now not readable with any confidence.
cu500 | 3 | There is a third fragment mounted with this papyrus, upside down near the top with three letter visible on it, which probably does not belong to this papyrus. 
cu500 | 4 | There are additional traces on the lefthand side of the front of Fragment 2 that are not transcribed in the original publication.
