cu245ab | 1 | Dedication?
cu245f | 1 | Ist-IInd cent. A.D.
cu300 | 1 | 1 block of local gypsum/anhydrite, 0.56 m x 0.36 m x 0.275 m.     
cu500 | 1 | 6 lines of text, with a lacuna of approx. 12 cm. separating the first line from the second.  The first line is in Latin; the subsequent 5 lines in Greek.
cu500 | 2 | The surface is badly damaged and the block was reused in a 4th cent. wall.  Hence there may have been more writing in the lacuna.       
cu500 | 3 | There also appears to have been some sculpted decoration, though all that remains are a few incised lines enclosing the Greek inscription.
cu500 | 4 | The first word of the first line appears to be a Roman proper name.
