cu500 | 2 | This text belongs to a group of 12 such customs documents discovered at Berenike.
cu500 | 3 | All of the orders in this group originated from one Herak- (the editors thought it best not to resolve the name) who commanded a certain Drakon to release goods for export.
cu500 | 4 | The word "koud( )" has been interpreted as an abbreviation for an uncertain Latin title beginning "Quad( )".
cu500 | 5 | The traces to the left and below the forth line most likely belong to a fifth line, which may have enumerated the quantity of an additional commodity.
