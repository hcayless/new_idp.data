cu245ab | 1 | Dedication to Zeus

cu300 | 1 | 1 inscribed block (type of stone not recorded), 0.225 m x 0.165-0.175 m x 0.12 m.
cu500 | 1 | 12 lines of text.     
cu500 | 2 | Dedication to Zeus by Philotera, daughter of Patentais.
cu500 | 3 | This inscription appears to be the rough copy of a text, the final version of which was found in the same trench (O.Ber. II 118).    
cu500 | 4 | The stone is unfinished: it is covered with the mason's rough boasting marks, and the fact that the lettering cuts through many of these chisel marks show that they are original, and not the product of preparation for reuse.
cu500 | 5 | The only changes from this copy to the final version are the distribution of words in lines 7-8, and the removal of the superfluous iota in Philotera's name (line 3).     
cu500 | 6 | This block and its companion were reused in a wall of a substantial structure from the late fourth to fifth cent. A.D.      
cu500 | 7 |
