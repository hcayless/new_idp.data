            <ab>(�) to the soldiers for their pay � he said that he would not embark with them unless (the others) all contributed for two years or collected the value quickly. Thereupon he returned towards the stated position. After this on being summoned by him on the following day in order that he might know what they would contribute and agree the amount with them, they were no longer to be seen. Accordingly he immediately went about the fields and, rounding up the cattle and sheep, brought them to the village and handed them over to the guards, their numbers severally being 580 sheep and lambs, 67 cows, bulls, and heifers; these he shut up in the temple, and hastened himself to the neighboring villages, leaving Dionysios as his deputy. After this he returned, and up to the time of writing is still in the village. The banker having arrived on the 8th, the bronze money aforesaid was paid to Poseidonios, agent of the banker Dionusios (Marginal note: the amount stated against each name). The priests who were purified for service have not touched any land (deletion: nor what was paid for the contribution. I have therefore written for your information). He stays and is using every means to persuade them. I have therefore written for your information.</ab>
