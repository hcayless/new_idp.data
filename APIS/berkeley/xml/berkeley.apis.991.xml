            <ab>... the collectors of the association artabas, and that Artemidoros the hated of heaven has embezzled as much as 25 association artabas of wheat out of what we had measured for the last half-artaba tax. Ptolemaios son of Harpsalis, too, has credited nothing to our account for the last half-artaba tax except only 25 artabas because you have not had a receipt, for you treat everything as by the way. When they wanted to take animals in pledge we refrained from using force against him, after I (?) had collected a number of men, and he would not wait till you arrived in health. When Demetrios arrived by chance at the village, they still did not depart, but he was persuaded to restrain himself (?) for the moment; and after I had extricated what was pledged they departed to other villages. You must know that I did not use force pending your speedy arrival. As for the business in the Herakleopolite nome, I with Ptolemaios have performed your orders. You are kept in remembrance by the whole household and your sister and Paraibates and Phileas and Demetria the younger. About the holding, it has recovered from the wet. Take care of yourself, in order that we may greet you in health as soon as possible. Goodbye. The 2nd year, Choiak 25. ï¿½ 500 drachmas.</ab>
