            <ab>� (Thenkebkis acknowledges) the receipt from him, Isidoros, � of 500 drachmas of silver, being the residue of payments for nursing and oil and other expenses during three years in which Sarapias, the slave of Thenkebkis, suckled and nurtured Eudaimon surnamed Mu�, the male child born to Isidoros by his slave � which child he has forthwith received back weaned and otherwise in good health (?). Thenkebkis also acknowledges that she has previously received from hand to hand without written record the � part of the price of the suckling and nursing, and that neither she, Thenkebkis, nor her agents will take proceedings concerning the wages received by her now and previously as aforesaid on account of the child Eudaimon surnamed Mu� or on any other matter whatever down to the present day in any wise; and the sum fixed for giving notice has also been received. � I, Thenkebkis daughter of Kronion also called Sarapammon with my husband Marsisouchos son of Maron as guardian, I have received from Isidoros the remaining drachmas for nursing fee, for the son of Isidoros Eudaimon surnamed Mu� which my slave Sarapias has suckled, and I will take no proceedings concerning these things nor concerning previous things as stated above. I, Marsisouchos, have written also for my wife, because she is illiterate.</ab>
