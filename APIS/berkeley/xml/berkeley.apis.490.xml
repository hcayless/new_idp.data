            <ab>(Scriptura interior) The 15th year which is also the 12th, Phaophi 24th in Kerkeosiris in the division of Polemon. Ptolemaios also called Petesouchos son of Apollonios also called Haryotes, Persian of the epigone, acknowledges to Horion son of Apollonios, Macedonian of the swordbearers in the group of the strategos, that he has leased from him, the catoecic plot of land which he himself has leased from Maron son of Dionysios, for 5 years from the 15th = 12th year, the whole rent in kind being for every year 120 artabas of wheat, subject to no deductions for loss, on the condition that he will break up at his own expense the dry ground in the holding except that which adjoins the land of Thoonis and Pausiris, for which Horion will pay 4 talents and 3000 drachmas in bronze, of which Ptolemaios has received at once 2 talents and 3000 drachmas, and the remaining 2 talents in two years from the 15th year, each year in the month Pachon, and he will each year sow one half with light crops and he will pay the coming expenses at the threshing floor and the logeutika-tax, being 3 artabas of wheat, and when the period of the lease have passed, he will show the land free from rushes, coarse grass, and other weeds, and if he wishes to break the whole dry ground in the 2nd year, he must pay him 2 talents in the month Pachon of the 15th year. (�) Keeper of the contract is Timostratos. (Scriptura exterior) In the reign of Kleopatra the goddess Euergetis and Ptolemaios surnamed Alexander, gods Philometores, the fifteenth which is also the twelfth year, the priest of Alexander and the rest being as written in Alexandria, the 24th of the month Xandicus which is the 24th of Phaophi, at Kerkeosiris in the division of Polemon of the Arsinoite nome. Ptolemaios also called Petesouchos, son of Apollonios also called Haryotes, Persian of the epigone, acknowledges to Horion son of Apollonios, Macedonian, one of the swordbearers in the group of the strategos, that he has leased from him the catoecic holding in three lots belonging to Maron son of Dionysios near the village, and leased by him to Horion, of which land the adjacent areas are: of the first lot on the south, separated by a canal, the land of the great god Mestasytmis and the Crown land of Horos son of Pekous, Thoonis and Pausiris, on the north the holding of Ptolemaios son of Apollonios, on the west and east canals; of the second lot on the south, north and west a field, on the east the holding of Apollodoros; and of the remaining lot on the south the holding of the aforesaid Apollodoros, on the north and east the holding of Asklepiades, on the west a field. This lease is for five years from the 15th which is also the 12th year at a yearly rent for the whole area of 120 artabas of wheat with no allowance for seed, warranted against all risks and subject to no deductions for loss, on condition that Ptolemaios shall break up at his own expense all the dry ground in the holding except that which adjoins the land of Thoonis and Pausiris, Horion paying him for the breaking up 4 talents 3000 drachmas of bronze, which are not to be returned; from which sum Ptolemaios has forthwith received 2 talents 3000 drachmas, the remaining two talents to be received within two years from the aforesaid 15th which is also the 12th year, one talent being paid in each year in the month of Pachon. Ptolemaios shall every year beginning with the second year of the lease sow half the holding with such light crops as he may select excluding oil-producing plants; and he shall in each year pay all the expenses and dues at the threshing floor to the amount of three artabas of wheat at his own charges. And when the term of the lease has expired Ptolemaios shall deliver up the land �, levelled and banked in and free from rushes, coarse grass, and other weeds, except the aforesaid dry ground. If Ptolemaios chooses to break up all the dry land in the second year, Horion shall pay him the aforesaid two talents of bronze in the month of Pachon of the 15th which is also the 12th year. Horion shall guarantee to Ptolemaios and his representatives the lease and the enjoyment of the produce of the land upon the terms arranged for the time appointed and for any extension that may be necessary, and he is not permitted to lease the land to others or expel Ptolemaios before the proper period or hinder him or his representatives from tilling the ground or watering the crop each year. And he shall also pay Ptolemaios within the appointed time the remaining two talents of bronze for the breaking up of the dry land, as is aforesaid. If he fails to guarantee them as aforesaid or violates any other of the aforesaid provisions, Horion shall forfeit to Ptolemaios a fine of 30 talents of bronze, and for failure to pay the money for the breaking up of the dry ground one and a half times that sum and the loss incurred, while the validity of the lease shall not be affected; and Ptolemaios himself and his representatives if they expel intruders upon the land shall be liable to no fine or penalty of any kind. If the lease is guaranteed Ptolemaios shall till the land and sow light crops on half of it every year, and he may not alienate the lease. The appointed rent shall be paid every year by Ptolemaios to Horion or his representatives in the month of Payni, payment being made in wheat that is new, pure and unadulterated in any way, measured by the six-choinix-measure of the avenue of the temple of Souchos in the aforesaid village by just measurement, and it shall be delivered to Horion at the village at whatever place he may fix in the said village at Ptolemaios' own expense. And when the period of the lease has expired Ptolemaios shall deliver up the land in a clean condition as aforesaid. But if he fails to pay the rent as aforesaid or violates any other of the aforesaid conditions, Ptolemaios shall forthwith forfeit to Horion for renouncing the lease a fine of 30 talents of bronze and the loss incurred, and for not sowing light crops yearly a fine of 10 artabas of wheat besides the rent, and for not delivering up the land in a clean condition a fine of 10 talents of bronze, and (for not paying the rent?) 3000 drachmas of bronze for each artaba or the highest price at which it may be sold at the said village; and Horion shall in each year own the harvest and produce until he recovers his rent in full and all the other provisions of the lease are fulfilled. If Ptolemaios is called upon to pay anything to the state on behalf of Maron, whose property has been impounded or of Horion, or to make any other contribution, he shall deduct in the allowance from the rent the equivalents of the sums in the tax-receipts, and if that is not sufficient to make good the debt Horion shall pay him the additional amount. If Horion fails to pay him as aforesaid, Ptolemaios has the right either, if he chooses, to exact the deficiency from him, or, if he prefers, to continue cultivation the holding at the same rent beyond the term of the lease until he recovers his debt in full with the (interst?). This contract is valid. The witnesses are: Timostratos son of Sarapion, Macedonian of the catoecic cavalry; Teres son of Ptolemaios; Hermon son of N.N.; Patron son of Ptolemaios; Herakleos son of Sarapion; all five Macedonians of the Epigone. The keeper of the contract is Timostratos. (2nd hand) I, Ptolemaios also called Petesouchos son of Apollonios also called Haryotes, Persian of the epigone, acknowledge that I have leased the holding which belongs to Maron for five years from the 15th which is also the 12th year at a total rent for each year of 120 artabas of wheat; and I have forthwith received the 2 talents 3000 drachmas in bronz for breaking the dry ground in the holding; and on receiving in addition 2 talents more I will deliver up the holding with the dry ground broken up and levelled and free from rushes, coarse grass, and other weeds, except that adjoining the land of Thoonis and Pausiris, and I accept the other stipulations as aforesaid; and I have placed this contract, being valid, with Timostratos. (3rd hand) I, Timostratos has received the contract, being valid. (1st hand) Registered in the 15th which is also the 12th year, Phaophi 24.</ab>
