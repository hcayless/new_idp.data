            <ab>To Aurelius Nemesion, manager, greeting. I have written to you on other occasions to remind you about the work, and I have heard that you have received the arakos from Amatios. So now as was ordered let the arakos and grass-arakos go alone to Tbeklutis for seed. Do not neglect the oxen or work them hard, for you know as well as I that they are underfed. For I ordered you, when I came up, to go to Nemera in the Oxyrhynchite nome to look for hay, and you have not yet told me about it, so I am at present very anxious. If you find any purchasers of the surplus donkeys get rid of as many as three. I wrote to you to send the animals laden with hay to Heron, so if you have not received the sheep for folding with you (?) do you provide the animals. If the cultivators come to you wanting seed, tell me at once in order that I may send a few measures to them from somewhere. Let me tell you that I have bought the two arouras of Regnuti[--] daughter of Labeon; so go there for their cultivation and release the laborer ï¿½ (send) some flax-straw to the farmstead and stay there until you get the price of it; be sure also to take the work I gave you for the farmstead. If you fare well, get together all you can and buy there a good tunic of the value of 40 drachmas. I pray for your health.</ab>
