After I had set out with Ammonios, having taken the animals from Oxyrhyncha, when we had carried down the wheat from Ibion and …, [finding] the bridge fallen we returned to Oxyrhyncha with nothing to do. I was unable to separate from Herakleides so as to go up because he said that we would proceed to Kaminoi …; … and send even now a man to be here in order that I myself may sail to the people at Theogonis and the other villages and see to my holding. Goodbye. The 9th year, Thoth 12. (Addressed on the verso) To Adamas.
