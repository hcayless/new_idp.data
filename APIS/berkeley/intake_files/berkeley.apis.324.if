dd500_tra | 1 | (3rd h.) Received in the 53rd year, Tybi 15. (1st h.) To Amenneus, Basilikos Grammateus, from Pnepheros son of Paous, contractor for the taxes on beer and natron at Kerkeosiris in the division of Polemon for the 53rd year. Having received certain information that the inhabitants of the village are with one accord claiming your protection, and being myself anxious to belong to your house because it devolves upon you before all others to watch over the interests of the crown, I beg you to order a letter to be sent to Demetrios the Epistates of the village and Nikanor the archiphylakites and Menches the village scribe and the elders of the cultivators, with instructions to compel the inhabitants to follow the ancient traditions, in order that I may be enabled to pay my dues regularly. Farewell. (2nd h.) To Menches, village scribe. Let justice be done to the tax-payer in accordance with the traditions of the village. The 53rd year, Tybi 13. (Addressed on the verso) To Menches.
