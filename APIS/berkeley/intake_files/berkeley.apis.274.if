(Col. II) My (garment?) is lost; violent was he (who took it?), well-born was he who took it. It was bought for ten staters; if it had been a cloak I should not have minded. I seek but do not find it. It was taken without cause. He will meet with anger. Just so he took it, my lovely garment. A lion he was who took it, a fool who lost it. It was taken at night. He was a stranger who took it, it was nothing to one like him. I will choke myself, for I am cold. He is indicated to me, for he watches me (?) … It is winter, there is great cold. How utterly unfortunate was I!
