dd500_tra | 1 | A servant speaks before his lord; [his son] Heni says: 'Attention a million times! Excellent is (giving) attention to him who makes (funerary) provision for you, about these things which your servant Seni has done, and to this humble servant's being made to see him (Seni) in a dream, in the same city as you. For, look, it was his character which carried himself off. For, look, the things which happened to him could not have happened through the action of this humble servant - that (action) wasn't the sum of all that happened. For, look, it wasn't I who har[med] him]. Others did it before this humble servant. Pray, may his lord be protective, may he be not evil-minded, may one beware of him, until he has failed to watch this humble servant, for eternity! alternative translation of last lines (Szpakowska 2003: 25 [she's an expert on dreams in ancient egypt) ... Please, may his lord be protective, and do not allow him to do harm. May he be guarded in order that he may be done with looking at me, your servant, forever!
