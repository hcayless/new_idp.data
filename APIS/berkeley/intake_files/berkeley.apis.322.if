dd500_tra | 1 | Polemon to Menches, greeting and good health. I have sent Harachthes to be with the komogrammateis until I come. You will do me a favor by personally introducing him and looking after them (him?), and in regard to the additions to the revenue letting him to nothing without your assistance, and if accounts are demanded consider that you have full powers until my arrival. Take care of yourself so as to remain in good health. Good-bye. The 4th year, Phamenoth 12. (Addressed on the verso) To Menches.
