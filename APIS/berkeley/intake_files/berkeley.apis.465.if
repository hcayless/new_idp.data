When I was in Ptolemais Euergetis for the delivery of the requested documents, we happened to hear about the fact that the Crown tenants from the village, leaving their present business, had gone away to the temple in Narmouthis on the 19th of the month below written. I considered it right to make a supplementary report so that you know. Good-bye. The 4th year, Phaophi 20.
