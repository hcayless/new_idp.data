In accordance with your request that I should do nothing further up to the 25th until I met Petesokonouris, having now waited instead of the 25th till the 5th of Mecheir without any of you having brought me to …, even so, notwithstanding my annoyance I have had patience and written to you: even now, if you have made any decision about what I had determined to do to Petesokonouris, come and bring him, on the understanding that I take such other steps as you prefer; and do not leave him and the office thus in the lurch and make trial of other measures. If another decision has been made, acquaint me. Goodbye. (P.S. in the top margin) I have written also to Petesokonouris himself the letter sealed up with this ... (Addressed on the verso) To the cultivator at Areos kome.
