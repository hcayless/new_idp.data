dd500_tra | 1 | To N.N. from N.N., registered at the Macedonians' quarter, acting with my guardian my maternal uncle N.N., son of Souchas. I lent by two public contracts drawn up through the record-office of Tebtunis in the 2nd year of Antoninus and Verus the lords Augusti, by the first on the 4th of the month Mecheir to Serenus and Didumos, both sons of Heron son of Souchas, their mother being Sarapous freedwoman of Thenzoila, of the Syrian quarter, the sum of 560 silver drachmas, in which contract they declared that they would keep unalienated and intact for me until the repayment of the sum the two-thirds of a catoecic holding of 3 1/2 arouras in two parcels near the village of Tebtunis jointly owned by them, and by the second on the 1st of the month Pachon to the aforesaid Serenus singly the further sum of [.]00 silver drachmas, wherein he too declared that he would keep unalienated and intact for me the two-thirds share belonging to him on the north side of 6 1/4 arouras, being the third part on the north side of 18 1/2 arouras near the said village of Tebtunis in the so-called … of Stasikles. As I am afraid that my right of procedure against the said arouras may escape notice, I present this statement in order that the registration may be made …, and if it be found that any other person has ownership of or claims against the land secured through the record office, no obstacle shall arise through this registration, in accordance with the copies of the deeds submitted by me. (2nd hand) I, N.N., scribe, have registered (this document). The sixth year of Antoninus and Verus the Lords Augusti, Mecheir 1.
