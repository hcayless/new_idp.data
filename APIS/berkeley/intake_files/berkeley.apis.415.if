dd500_tra | 1 | Copy. To Tiberius Claudius Justus, administrator of the private accounts, from Pakebkis son of Marsisouchos, exempted priest from the famous temple of Soknebtunis also called Kronos and the most great associated gods situated at the village of Tebtunis in the division of Polemon in the Arsinoite nome. I wish to purchase the office of prophetes in the aforesaid temple which has been for a long time offered for sale, on the condition that I shall … and carry the palm-branches and perform all the other functions attaching to the office and receive in accordance with the orders the fifth part of the whole revenue which falls to the temple, at the total price of 2200 drachmas instead of the 640 drachmas long ago offered by Marsisouchos son of Pakebkis, which sum I will, as soon as my appointment is ratified, pay into the local public bank at the accustomed dates; and I and my descendants and assigns shall have the permanent ownership and possession of the office for ever with all the same privileges and rights, on payment of 200 drachmas for admission. If therefore it seem good to you, my lord, you will ratify my appointment here at the metropolis upon these terms, and write to the strategos of the nome on the matter, in order that the due services of the gods who love you may be performed. The fifth share of the proceeds of the revenues which falls to me, as aforesaid, after the expenses are paid is 50 artabas of wheat, 9 5/6 artabas of lentils, and 60 drachmas of silver. Farewell. The 10th year of Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Tybi 10.
