If any of us four violates any of the aforesaid provisions, he shall pay to the party abiding by them 500 drachmas and to the Treasury an equal sum. This bond shall be valid, as if it had been publicly registered. The coming extra levy of the present third year shall be demanded by them from the classes of persons which they have severally been allotted.
