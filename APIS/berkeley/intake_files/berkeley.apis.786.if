Before all else I supplicate the lord Sarapis and the associated gods on your behalf, praying that you may have life's greatest blessings. You will do well, brother, to come up and bring my wife with you, for I have written to her to come with you; and give her any money she may need until you arrive and receive it back from me in good faith, as I have trusted no one to take it to her. Salute all your family for me; I pray for the health and prosperity of them and you and all your household. (Addressed on the verso) To Origenes from his friend Soterichos.
