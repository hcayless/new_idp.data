dd500_tra | 1 | To Sarapion also called Agathos Daimon and Serenus also called Diodoros, ex-gumnasiarchs and epikritai, from Eudaimon son of Heron son of Souchas, his mother being Heron's sister Thermoutharion, and from his wife Sarapias who is his sister on both his father's and his mother's side, both from the metropolis and registered in the Treasuries' quarter, Sarapias acting under the guardianship of Eudaimon. Since Heron, the son that has been born to us, is in the present 21st year of Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Caesar the lord approaching (the age of fourteen) and ought to be selected, we append our claims. We were both returned in the census of the 20th year of the deified Aelius Antoninus and of the 14th of the deified Aurelius Antoninus in the aforesaid Treasuries' quarter, returning along with ourselves in the census of the 14th year only our son Heron who is now a candidate for selection; accordingly we present this petition. Signed by me, Sarapion also called Agathos Daimon, ex-gumnasiarch, through Antoninus, scribe. The 21st year of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, Epeiph 7.
