dd500_tra | 1 | The 21st year, Phaophi 11. To Philon, archiphylakites, from Dionysios and Adamas, 30-arouras-holders, and Poseidonios. On the night between the 10th and 11th of the aforesaid month certain persons climbed into our house, and coming into the vestibule, while our people were asleep in their chambers with the doors shut, went away with a grain-basket in the vestibule containing a half-artaba of barley worth 90 drachmas, the value of the basket being 20 dr., 2 torn linen cloths, which were in the basket, worth 600 dr., a cloth made of goats' hair, worth 300 dr., 2 sweaters worth 120 dr., a four-choinix measure, 50 dr., so that the value of the stolen goods amounts to one thousand one hundred and eighty drachmas, total 1,180 dr. Having handed in on the same day a report of these things to Horos the komarches of Satyrou Laura, we accordingly ask you, if you please, to order a letter to be written to the proper officials to … a copy in order that it may be (retained?) by you so as to be available for us in the legal inquiry before Horos. Farewell.
