dd500_tra | 1 | Heron to his esteemed Heron, greeting. Tomorrow, which is the 25th, be sure to send the ass to be branded. See that you do not neglect this, as the tribune (?) came here today about it. If my daughter is ready, let her come up on the ass, and do not let the other ass come up until I tell you. But if my daughter is not coming, load the ass with fodder, and send it at dusk. Be heedful of the watering of the colophonium and simiais, and about the fodder. I pray for your good health. (Addressed on the recto) To Heron, phrontistes.
