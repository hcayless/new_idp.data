dd500_tra | 1 | To Ptolemaios, a chief of the body-guard and strategos, from Herieus son of Harphaesis, a cultivator of Crown land, living a Psinteo. My father having died when I was still young, Thareus, a woman of Thebes, doing violence to me, and taking as her assistants Diotimos the agent of Demetrios the superintendent of the gift-estate, and Heliodoros the …, in defiance of all right built a tower ten cubits high on the unoccupied plot which came to me from my father. But the ordinance declares "If any person build upon the land of another, let him be deprived of the building." And whereas Thareus has since died and a certain Petesouchos and his sister Kamous lay claim to her property, I request you to summon them and to inquire into this matter, and, if it be as I say, to compel them to leave the plot. If this is done, I shall receive relief by your means. To Apollonios. Bring them up. The 10th year, Pharmouthi 29.
