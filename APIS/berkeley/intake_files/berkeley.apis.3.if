Phanesis, komogrammateus of Koitai, having sent me the appended letter in which he declares that he has persuaded the crown cultivators of Dinnys, who were objecting to the land added by him, to accept on agreed terms the land they objected to, we thought it necessary to report to you in order that, if you think fit, you may give orders that arrangements be made for the delivery of the rent to the treasury. I appended the letter.
