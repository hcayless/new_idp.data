I wish to lease for five years from the present 15th year of Hadrianus Caesar the Lord the one aroura of the land near the village which I previously cultivated and of which the period of the lease expired in the past 14th year, the adjoining areas being on the south the holding of Kronion, on the north a water-channel, on the west the holding of the said Kronion, on the east the land belonging to me, Tithoes, at the rent paid before, namely one artaba of barley a year without seed. If any further part of it becomes unirrigated, an allowance of the rent shall be made to me, if you consent to lease the land. (2nd hand) To the komogrammateus. If he is a man of substance, execute the lease in the proper way, remembering that you will be held responsible and that no one ought to be a cultivator without inquiry. The 15th year of Hadrianus Caesar the lord, Mecheir 6. (3rd hand) I, Ptolemaios, have signed it.
