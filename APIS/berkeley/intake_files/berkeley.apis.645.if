dd500_tra | 1 | (2nd hand) Signed by me, Moschion. 11th year of Trajanus Hadrianus Augustus, the 27th of the month Kaisareios. (1st hand) To Ision (?) and Theon, ex-kosmetai, ex-gumnasiarchs, keepers of the property-registers of the Arsinoite nome, from Eutuchos also called Herakleides, son of Marsisouchos, an inhabitant of the village of Tebtunis in the division of Polemon. I register for the first time a property which I have today bought from Taorsenouphis daughter of Pasis son of Harmiusis, inhabitant of the said village, with her guardian who is her cousin on the mother's side, Orseus son of Hermes, the paternal house and court which she owns at the village, free from debt, mortgage and every kind of pledge, at the price of 200 drachmas of silver. Wherefore I make this return. (2nd hand) Entered on the register for the first time.
