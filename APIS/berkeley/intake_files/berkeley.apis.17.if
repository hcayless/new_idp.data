dd500_tra | 1 | To Menches, komogrammateus of Kerkeosiris, from Portis son of Portis, crown tenant and inhabitant of the same village. On 8 Mesore of the 4th year Pyrrhichos son of Dionysios, a catoecic cavalryman, and Herakleios son of Poseidippos, an inhabitant of the same village, with very many other persons armed with swords, suddenly came upon the house that I have rebuilt. Having made an entry, they carried off the articles listed below, although there was no dispute whatever between me and them. I therefore present to you this complaint so that you may subscribe to my statements, having added below a copy of the petition for the competent authorities, so that, when the accused have been presented for trial, I may recover my own property and the accused may receive the punishment they deserve.
