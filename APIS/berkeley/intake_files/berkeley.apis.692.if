dd500_tra | 1 | Aphrodite to her mistress Arsinoes, many greetings. I make supplication for you to the gods of this place every day, praying for your health. I restored at once to Mamertinus' wife what you sent, and Serenion took the papyrus sealed. Do not think, mistress, that I am negligent of your commands. Euphrosune, after she had cut the robe, inquired of Isidoros. Receive through Artes (?) the hold-all, 4 bags, 4 Puteolan articles, 1 … and 5 reeds of thread; it was arranged with you that these should be sent from her earnings. I have received the shirt from Didumos. We are late in sending you letters because we have no … Ambrosia, …, Athenodoros, Thermouthis and her household salute you, and all your friends salute your friends. (Addressed on the verso) Deliver from Aphrodite to her mistress.
