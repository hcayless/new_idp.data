On the 1st of the current month at about the eleventh hour a disturbance occurred in the village, and on running out we found a crowd of the villagers who had come to the assistance of Polemon, who is performing the duties of Epistates of the village. When we inquired into the matter, they informed us that Apollodoros and his son Maron had assaulted Polemon; that Apollodoros had escaped, but Maron had been put in prison; and that the latter had appeared before Ptolemaios the king's relative and strategos on the 1st. We thought it well to notify the matter for your information. Good-bye. The 3rd year, Mesore 2.
