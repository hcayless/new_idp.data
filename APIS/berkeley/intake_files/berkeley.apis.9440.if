dd500_pal | 1 | The text is written very fluidly and must have been written by an experienced hand. There is even spacing between lines and it is very legible. The abstract appears to be slightly more cursive and the text a little more faded than the body of the document. Some paleographical peculiarities of the hand which wrote this document are among the following: two diagonal strokes are used for the house determinative in qd, hbs, and wrh.
