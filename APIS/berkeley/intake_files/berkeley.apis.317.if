Some of the hindrances placed in the way of the performance of our work through the insolent conduct of the komogrammateis in the nome, and how further in Mesore of the (52nd?) year, when we visited various places in the nome, having been appointed for this duty and wishing to inquire into the reports sent from the nome, namely the list of deductions and so on, they had gone without giving us the written records, have been recounted by us to Eirenaios in the appended letter. At the present time also they show the same behavior in their reports, and when the crop … in order to prevent the details being accurately known … and have made the voyage down to the city as said, we beg you to look into the matters indicated, and if any advantage to the treasury can be gained by the coming inquiries, to make arrangements for seeing that the persons mentioned are secured, in order that the rest may obtain a conspicuous illustration to show how you will suppress wrong-doing and may be thereby incited to make easier for us the performance of our duty in connection with the inquiries, and that the Crown interests may be in no way neglected. Good-bye.
