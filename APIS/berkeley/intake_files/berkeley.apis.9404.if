dd520 | 1 | The papyrus appears to be an account for a building project, probably a temple. Workers are assigned to tasks for building "is-chambers", "h3t-chamber, "wsht-chamber", and other jobs of related nature. It is thus likely that the document relates to the account of a temple building project. A few officials are named in the document including the scribe Si-Hathor and the Chamberlain Dedu-Nebu. The format of the document is drawn up like a ledger listing names and numbers. The location of the project is also mentioned as being "in Tjeni."
