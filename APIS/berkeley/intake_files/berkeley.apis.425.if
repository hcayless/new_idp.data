dd500_tra | 1 | To king Ptolemaios and Queen Kleopatra, his sister, motherloving gods, greeting from Petesouchos son of Petos, Crown cultivator from the village of Oxyrhyncha in the division of Polemon in the Arsinoite nome. I live in Kerkeosiris in the said nome, and there belongs to me in the aforesaid village of Oxyrhyncha a house inherited from my father, possessed by him for the period of his lifetime and by myself after his decease up to the present time with no dispute. But Stratonike daughter of Ptolemaios, an inhabitant of Krokodilon polis in the aforementioned nome, mischievously wishing to practice extortion on me, coming with other persons against the aforesaid house, forces her way in before any judgement has been given and … in the village about … the house, coming in and laying claim to it wrongfully. I therefore pray you, mighty gods, if you see fit, to send my petition to Menekrates, archisomatophylax and strategos, so that he may order Stratonike not to force her way into the house, but, if she thinks she has grievance, to get redress from me in the proper manner. If this is done, I shall have received succor. Farewell.
