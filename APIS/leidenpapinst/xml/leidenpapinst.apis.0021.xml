                 <summary>The contents of this papyrus are mainly of a magic character; the first column of the verso is astrological. On the verso we read first an amatory spell, to which are added some directions if the god delays to appear, and the words necessary to procure his dismissal. There follows a method to ascertain through reckoning whether a certain person lives or is dead, but this part is very unclear. Along the bottom a row of magical signs. The verso first gives four horoscopes, then an incantation directed against a woman, with magic words and a magic figure. The third column begins with a new spell.</summary>

'Thou art the fire unquenchable that is set beside the great god Osornophris Osor --. Thou didst minister to him when he fell in love with his own (5) sister Senephtys and didst run six times sixty leagues and didst encompass six times sixty mountains. Even so minister to me, NN, in regard to NN. Else I will utter the eight letters of the moon (10) which have been fixed on the heart of the sun, and if I am about to speak and you have not yet departed, I will go within the seven gates round Dardaniel and will shake the foundation of the earth and (15) the four elements of the world shall be merged together in order that their product may become nought. Be thou dissolved into thine own nature and mix with the air and go to NN daughter of NN – ordinary speech – and bring her to me with thy thunderous fire. I adjure you, the great god, (20) set in the pure earth, by whom the fire is set unquenchable for ever. Athouin thrice, (magic words), ordinary speech.'

Hail lord (magic words)'. Say this many times, and if you proceed, the phantom delays: 'Open, heaven; open, Olympus; open, Hades; open, abyss; (30) let the darkness be divided at the command of the most high god and let the sacred light come forth from the infinite into the abyss.'

'Approach, o lord god; hail, sacred light; hail, eye of the world; hail, ray of dawn upon the world; (35) and give me an answer concerning the things I beg of thee.' And ask what you wish.

These characters are made. And you shall set the stone outside on the left of the cup and, grasping it (?) with both hands, recite as it was explained to you. Throw (the magnet?) into the cup. Plunge in it the afterbirth of a bitch called White, viz. of a pup white when born, or a --- membrane (?). (45) And write with myrrh on the boy's breast Karbaoth.
