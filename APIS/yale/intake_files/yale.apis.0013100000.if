cu500 | 1 | This manuscript has been missing from the collection since sometime before 1971. Probably it was described in a preliminary inventory of this acquisition (see the file for acquisition 1931c in the "Papyrology File"), but because the numbers used there do not correspond exactly with the P.Yale inv. numbers assigned to this acquisition later, it is not clear which item in the inventory is to be matched with this missing manuscript; the most likely candidate is item 1311 ("6.5 x 10 [cm]. Tattered fragment, written in two hands. Writing badly preserved"), but also possible are items 1301, 1298, 1260, etc. No description exists in the old card files
