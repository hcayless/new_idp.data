# Papyri.info IDP (Integrating Digital Papyrology) Data

This is a shallow copy of the idp.data repo, with P.Louvre 1 4 elaborated as an example of how the new framework for curated vs. static texts might work. The [`Static`](https://github.com/hcayless/new_idp.data/tree/main/Static) directory contains static texts, either fully transcribed (BGU 1 1) or stubs (e.g. BGU 1 337). The [`DDbDB`](https://github.com/hcayless/new_idp.data/tree/main/DDbDP) directory contains curated texts.
